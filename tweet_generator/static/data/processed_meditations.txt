  
i
learned
from
my
grandfather 
verus 
to
use
good
manners 
and
to
put
restraint
on
anger 
  
in
the
famous
memory
of
my
father
i
had
a
pattern
of
modesty
and
manliness 
  
of
my
mother
i
learned
to
be
pious
and
generous 
to
keep
myself
not
only
from
evil
deeds 
but
even
from
evil
thoughts 
and
to
live
with
a
simplicity
which
is
far
from
customary
among
the
rich 
  
i
owe
it
to
my
great grandfather
that
i
did
not
attend
public
lectures
and
discussions 
but
had
good
and
able
teachers
at
home 
and
i
owe
him
also
the
knowledge
that
for
things
of
this
nature
a
man
should
count
no
expense
too
great 
  
my
tutor
taught
me
not
to
favour
either
green
or
blue
at
the
chariot
races 
nor 
in
the
contests
of
gladiators 
to
be
a
supporter
either
of
light
or
heavy
armed 
he
taught
me
also
to
endure
labour 
not
to
need
many
things 
to
serve
myself
without
troubling
others 
not
to
intermeddle
in
the
affairs
of
others 
and
not
easily
to
listen
to
slanders
against
them 
  
of
diognetus
i
had
the
lesson
not
to
busy
myself
about
vain
things 
not
to
credit
the
great
professions
of
such
as
pretend
to
work
wonders 
or
of
sorcerers
about
their
charms 
and
their
expelling
of
demons
and
the
like 
not
to
keep
quails
 for
fighting
or
divination  
nor
to
run
after
such
things 
to
suffer
freedom
of
speech
in
others 
and
to
apply
myself
heartily
to
philosophy 
him
also
i
must
thank
for
my
hearing
first
bacchius 
then
tandasis
and
marcianus 
that
i
wrote
dialogues
in
my
youth 
and
took
a
liking
to
the
philosopher s
pallet
and
skins 
and
to
the
other
things
which 
by
the
grecian
discipline 
belong
to
that
profession 
  
to
rusticus
i
owe
my
first
apprehensions
that
my
nature
needed
reform
and
cure 
and
that
i
did
not
fall
into
the
ambition
of
the
common
sophists 
either
by
composing
speculative
writings
or
by
declaiming
harangues
of
exhortation
in
public 
further 
that
i
never
strove
to
be
admired
by
ostentation
of
great
patience
in
an
ascetic
life 
or
by
display
of
activity
and
application 
that
i
gave
over
the
study
of
rhetoric 
poetry 
and
the
graces
of
language 
and
that
i
did
not
pace
my
house
in
my
senatorial
robes 
or
practise
any
similar
affectation 
i
observed
also
the
simplicity
of
style
in
his
letters 
particularly
in
that
which
he
wrote
to
my
mother
from
sinuessa 
i
learned
from
him
to
be
easily
appeased 
and
to
be
readily
reconciled
with
those
who
had
displeased
me
or
given
cause
of
offence 
so
soon
as
they
inclined
to
make
their
peace 
to
read
with
care 
not
to
rest
satisfied
with
a
slight
and
superficial
knowledge 
nor
quickly
to
assent
to
great
talkers 
i
have
him
to
thank
that
i
met
with
the
discourses
of
epictetus 
which
he
furnished
me
from
his
own
library 
  
from
apollonius
i
learned
true
liberty 
and
tenacity
of
purpose 
to
regard
nothing
else 
even
in
the
smallest
degree 
but
reason
always 
and
always
to
remain
unaltered
in
the
agonies
of
pain 
in
the
losses
of
children 
or
in
long
diseases 
he
afforded
me
a
living
example
of
how
the
same
man
can 
upon
occasion 
be
most
yielding
and
most
inflexible 
he
was
patient
in
exposition 
and 
as
might
well
be
seen 
esteemed
his
fine
skill
and
ability
in
teaching
others
the
principles
of
philosophy
as
the
least
of
his
endowments 
it
was
from
him
that
i
learned
how
to
receive
from
friends
what
are
thought
favours
without
seeming
humbled
by
the
giver
or
insensible
to
the
gift 
  
sextus
was
my
pattern
of
a
benign
temper 
and
his
family
the
model
of
a
household
governed
by
true
paternal
affection 
and
a
steadfast
purpose
of
living
according
to
nature 
here
i
could
learn
to
be
grave
without
affectation 
to
observe
sagaciously
the
several
dispositions
and
inclinations
of
my
friends 
to
tolerate
the
ignorant
and
those
who
follow
current
opinions
without
examination 
his
conversation
showed
how
a
man
may
accommodate
himself
to
all
men
and
to
all
companies 
for
though
companionship
with
him
was
sweeter
and
more
pleasing
than
any
sort
of
flattery 
yet
he
was
at
the
same
time
highly
respected
and
reverenced 
no
man
was
ever
more
happy
than
he
in
comprehending 
finding
out 
and
arranging
in
exact
order
the
great
maxims
necessary
for
the
conduct
of
life 
his
example
taught
me
to
suppress
even
the
least
appearance
of
anger
or
any
other
passion 
but
still 
with
all
this
perfect
tranquillity 
to
possess
the
tenderest
and
most
affectionate
heart 
to
be
apt
to
approve
others
yet
without
noise 
to
have
much
learning
and
little
ostentation 
   
i
learned
from
alexander
the
grammarian
to
avoid
censuring
others 
to
refrain
from
flouting
them
for
a
barbarism 
solecism 
or
any
false
pronunciation 
rather
was
i
dexterously
to
pronounce
the
words
rightly
in
my
answer 
confining
approval
or
objection
to
the
matter
itself 
and
avoiding
discussion
of
the
expression 
or
to
use
some
other
form
of
courteous
suggestion 
   
fronto
made
me
sensible
how
much
of
envy 
deceit
and
hypocrisy
surrounds
princes 
and
that
generally
those
whom
we
account
nobly
born
have
somehow
less
natural
affection 
   
i
learned
from
alexander
the
platonist
not
often
nor
without
great
necessity
to
say 
or
write
to
any
man
in
a
letter 
that
i
am
not
at
leisure 
nor
thus 
under
pretext
of
urgent
affairs 
to
make
a
practice
of
excusing
myself
from
the
duties
which 
according
to
our
various
ties 
we
owe
to
those
with
whom
we
live 
   
of
catulus
i
learned
not
to
condemn
any
friend s
expostulation
even
though
it
were
unjust 
but
to
try
to
recall
him
to
his
former
disposition 
to
stint
no
praise
in
speaking
of
my
masters 
as
is
recounted
of
domitius
and
athenodorus 
and
to
love
my
children
with
true
affection 
   
of
severus 
my
brother 
i
learned
to
love
my
kinsmen 
to
love
truth 
to
love
justice 
through
him
i
came
to
know
thrasea 
helvidius 
cato 
dion 
and
brutus 
he
gave
me
my
first
conception
of
a
commonwealth
founded
upon
equitable
laws
and
administered
with
equality
of
right 
and
of
a
monarchy
whose
chief
concern
is
the
freedom
of
its
subjects 
of
him
i
learned
likewise
a
constant
and
harmonious
devotion
to
philosophy 
to
be
ready
to
do
good 
to
be
generous
with
all
my
heart 
he
taught
me
to
be
of
good
hope
and
trustful
of
the
affection
of
my
friends 
i
observed
in
him
candour
in
declaring
what
he
condemned
in
the
conduct
of
others 
and
so
frank
and
open
was
his
behaviour 
that
his
friends
might
easily
see
without
the
trouble
of
conjecture
what
he
liked
or
disliked 
   
the
counsels
of
maximus
taught
me
to
command
myself 
to
judge
clearly 
to
be
of
good
courage
in
sickness
and
other
misfortunes 
to
be
moderate 
gentle 
yet
serious
in
disposition 
and
to
accomplish
my
appointed
task
without
repining 
all
men
believed
that
he
spoke
as
he
thought 
and
whatever
he
did 
they
knew
it
was
done
with
good
intent 
i
never
found
him
surprised
or
astonished
at
anything 
he
was
never
in
a
hurry 
never
shrank
from
his
purpose 
was
never
at
a
loss
or
dejected 
he
was
no
facile
smiler 
but
neither
was
he
passionate
or
suspicious 
he
was
ready
to
do
good 
to
forgive 
and
to
speak
the
truth 
and
gave
the
impression
of
unperverted
rectitude
rather
than
of
a
reformed
character 
no
man
could
ever
think
himself
despised
by
maximus 
and
no
one
ever
ventured
to
think
himself
his
superior 
he
had
also
a
good
gift
of
humour 
   
i
learned
from
my
father
gentleness
and
undeviating
constancy
in
judgments
formed
after
due
reflection 
not
to
be
puffed
up
with
glory
as
men
understand
it 
to
be
laborious
and
assiduous 
he
taught
me
to
give
ready
hearing
to
any
man
who
offered
anything
tending
to
the
common
good 
to
mete
out
impartial
justice
to
every
one 
to
apprehend
rightly
when
severity
and
when
clemency
should
be
used 
to
abstain
from
all
impure
lusts 
and
to
use
humanity
towards
all
men 
thus
he
left
his
friends
at
liberty
to
sup
with
him
or
not 
to
go
abroad
with
him
or
not 
exactly
as
they
inclined 
and
they
found
him
still
the
same
if
some
urgent
business
had
prevented
them
from
obeying
his
commands 
i
learned
of
him
accuracy
and
patience
in
council 
for
he
never
quitted
an
enquiry
satisfied
with
first
impressions 
i
observed
his
zeal
to
retain
his
friends
without
being
fickle
or
over
fond 
his
contentment
in
every
condition 
his
cheerfulness 
his
forethought
about
very
distant
events 
his
unostentatious
attention
to
the
smallest
details 
his
restraint
of
all
popular
applause
and
flattery 
ever
watchful
of
the
needs
of
the
empire 
a
careful
steward
of
the
public
revenue 
he
was
tolerant
of
the
censure
of
others
in
affairs
of
that
kind 
he
was
neither
a
superstitious
worshipper
of
the
gods 
nor
an
ambitious
pleaser
of
men 
nor
studious
of
popularity 
but
in
all
things
sober
and
steadfast 
well
skilled
in
what
was
honourable 
never
affecting
novelties 
as
to
the
things
which
make
the
ease
of
life 
and
which
fortune
can
supply
in
such
abundance 
he
used
them
without
pride 
and
yet
with
all
freedom 
enjoyed
them
without
affectation
when
they
were
present 
and
when
absent
he
found
no
want
of
them 
no
man
could
call
him
sophist 
buffoon 
or
pedant 
he
was
a
man
of
ripe
experience 
a
full
man 
one
who
could
not
be
flattered 
and
who
could
govern
himself
as
well
as
others 
i
further
observed
that
he
honoured
all
who
were
true
philosophers 
without
upbraiding
the
rest 
and
without
being
led
astray
by
any 
his
manners
were
easy 
his
conversation
delightful 
but
not
cloying 
he
took
regular
but
moderate
care
of
his
body 
neither
as
one
over
fond
of
life
or
of
the
adornment
of
his
person 
nor
as
one
who
despised
these
things 
thus 
through
his
own
care 
he
seldom
needed
any
medicines 
whether
salves
or
potions 
it
was
his
special
merit
to
yield
without
envy
to
any
who
had
acquired
any
special
faculty 
as
either
eloquence 
or
learning
in
the
law 
in
ancient
customs 
or
the
like 
and
he
aided
such
men
strenuously 
so
that
every
one
of
them
might
be
regarded
and
esteemed
for
his
special
excellence 
he
observed
carefully
the
ancient
customs
of
his
forefathers 
and
preserved 
without
appearance
of
affectation 
the
ways
of
his
native
land 
he
was
not
fickle
and
capricious 
and
loved
not
change
of
place
or
employment 
after
his
violent
fits
of
headache
he
would
return
fresh
and
vigorous
to
his
wonted
affairs 
of
secrets
he
had
few 
and
these
seldom 
and
such
only
as
concerned
public
matters 
he
displayed
discretion
and
moderation
in
exhibiting
shows
for
the
entertainment
of
the
people 
in
his
public
works 
in
largesses
and
the
like 
and
in
all
those
things
he
acted
like
one
who
regarded
only
what
was
right
and
becoming
in
the
things
themselves 
and
not
the
reputation
that
might
follow
after 
he
never
bathed
at
unseasonable
hours 
had
no
vanity
in
building 
was
never
solicitous
either
about
his
food
or
about
the
make
or
colour
of
his
clothes 
or
about
the
beauty
of
his
servants 
his
dress
came
from
lorium  his
villa
on
the
coast  and
was
of
lanuvian
wool
for
the
most
part 
it
is
remembered
how
he
used
the
tax collector
at
tusculum
who
asked
his
pardon 
and
all
his
behaviour
was
of
a
piece
with
that 
he
was
far
from
being
inhuman 
or
implacable 
or
violent 
never
doing
anything
with
such
keenness
that
one
could
say
he
was
sweating
about
it 
in
all
things
he
reasoned
distinctly 
as
one
at
leisure 
calmly 
regularly 
resolutely 
and
consistently 
a
man
might
fairly
apply
that
to
him
which
is
recorded
of
socrates 
that
he
could
both
abstain
from
and
enjoy
these
things 
in
want
whereof
many
show
themselves
weak 
and 
in
the
possession 
intemperate 
to
be
strong
in
abstinence
and
temperate
in
enjoyment 
to
be
sober
in
both  these
are
qualities
of
a
man
of
perfect
and
invincible
soul 
as
was
shown
in
the
sickness
of
maximus 
   
to
the
gods
i
owe
it
that
i
had
good
grandfathers
and
parents 
a
good
sister 
good
teachers 
good
servants 
good
kinsmen 
and
friends 
good
almost
all
of
them 
i
have
to
thank
them
that
i
never
through
haste
and
rashness
offended
any
of
them 
though
my
temper
was
such
as
might
have
led
me
to
it
had
occasion
offered 
but
by
their
goodness
no
such
concurrence
of
circumstances
happened
as
could
discover
my
weakness 
i
am
further
thankful
that
i
was
not
longer
brought
up
with
my
grandfather s
concubine 
that
i
retained
my
modesty 
and
refrained
even
longer
than
need
have
been
from
the
pleasures
of
love 
to
the
gods
it
is
due
that
i
lived
under
the
government
of
such
a
prince
and
father
as
could
take
from
me
all
vain
glory 
and
convince
me
that
it
was
not
impossible
for
a
prince
to
live
in
a
court
without
guards 
gorgeous
robes 
torches 
statues 
or
such
pieces
of
state
and
magnificence 
but
that
he
may
reduce
himself
almost
to
the
state
of
a
private
man 
and
yet
not
become
more
mean
or
remiss
in
those
public
affairs
wherein
power
and
authority
are
requisite 
i
thank
the
gods
that
i
have
had
such
a
brother
as
by
his
disposition
might
stir
me
to
take
care
of
myself 
while
at
the
same
time
he
delighted
me
by
his
respect
and
love 
i
thank
them
that
my
children
neither
wanted
good
natural
dispositions
nor
were
deformed
in
body 
i
owe
it
to
their
good
guidance
that
i
made
no
greater
progress
in
rhetoric
and
poetry 
and
in
other
studies
which
might
have
engrossed
my
mind
had
i
found
myself
successful
in
them 
by
the
gods 
grace
i
forestalled
the
wishes
of
those
by
whom
i
was
brought
up 
in
promoting
them
to
the
dignities
they
seemed
most
to
desire 
and
i
did
not
put
them
off
with
the
hope
that 
since
they
were
but
young 
i
would
do
it
hereafter 
i
owe
to
the
gods
that
i
ever
knew
apollonius 
rusticus
and
maximus 
that
i
have
had
occasion
often
and
effectually
to
meditate
with
myself
and
enquire
what
is
truly
the
life
according
to
nature 
and 
as
far
as
lies
within
the
dispensation
of
the
gods
to
give
suggestion 
help 
or
inspiration 
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
my
having
already
realized
that
life 
i
have
fallen
short
of
it
by
my
own
fault 
and
because
i
gave
no
heed
to
the
inward
monitions
and
almost
direct
instructions
of
the
gods 
to
whom
be
thanks
that
my
body
hath
so
long
endured
the
stress
of
such
a
life
as
i
have
led 
by
their
goodness
i
never
had
to
do
with
either
benedicta
or
theodotus 
and
afterwards 
when
i
fell
into
some
foolish
passions 
i
was
soon
cured 
i
give
thanks
that 
having
often
been
displeased
with
rusticus 
i
never
did
anything
to
him
which
afterwards
i
might
have
had
occasion
to
repent 
that 
though
my
mother
was
destined
to
die
young 
she
lived
with
me
all
her
latter
years 
that 
as
often
as
i
inclined
to
succour
any
who
were
either
poor
or
had
fallen
into
some
distress 
i
was
never
answered
that
there
was
not
ready
money
enough
to
do
it 
and
that
i
myself
never
had
need
of
the
like
succour
from
another 
i
must
be
grateful 
too 
that
i
have
such
a
wife 
so
obedient 
so
loving 
so
ingenuous 
that
i
had
choice
of
fit
and
able
men
to
whom
i
might
commit
the
education
of
my
children 
i
have
received
divine
aids
in
dreams 
as
in
particular 
how
i
might
stay
my
spitting
of
blood
and
cure
my
vertigo 
which
good
fortune
happily
fell
to
me
at
caieta 
the
gods
watched
over
me
also
when
i
first
applied
myself
to
philosophy 
for
i
fell
not
into
the
hands
of
any
sophist 
nor
sat
poring
over
many
volumes 
nor
devoted
myself
to
solving
syllogisms 
or
star gazing 
that
all
these
things
should
so
happily
fall
out
there
was
great
need
both
for
the
help
of
fortune
and
for
the
aid
of
the
gods 
  
say
this
to
yourself
in
the
morning 
today
i
shall
have
to
do
with
meddlers 
with
the
ungrateful 
with
the
insolent 
with
the
crafty 
with
the
envious
and
the
selfish 
all
these
vices
have
beset
them 
because
they
know
not
what
is
good
and
what
is
evil 
but
i
have
considered
the
nature
of
the
good 
and
found
it
beautiful 
i
have
beheld
the
nature
of
the
bad 
and
found
it
ugly 
i
also
understand
the
nature
of
the
evil doer 
and
know
that
he
is
my
brother 
not
because
he
shares
with
me
the
same
blood
or
the
same
seed 
but
because
he
is
a
partaker
of
the
same
mind
and
of
the
same
portion
of
immortality 
i
therefore
cannot
be
hurt
by
any
of
these 
since
none
of
them
can
involve
me
in
any
baseness 
i
cannot
be
angry
with
my
brother 
or
sever
myself
from
him 
for
we
are
made
by
nature
for
mutual
assistance 
like
the
feet 
the
hands 
the
eyelids 
the
upper
and
lower
rows
of
teeth 
it
is
against
nature
for
men
to
oppose
each
other 
and
what
else
is
anger
and
aversion 
  
all
that
i
am
is
either
flesh 
breath 
or
the
ruling
part 
cast
your
books
from
you 
distract
yourself
no
more 
for
you
have
not
the
right
to
do
so 
like
one
at
the
point
of
death
despise
this
flesh 
this
corruptible
bone
and
blood 
this
network
texture
of
nerves 
veins 
and
arteries 
consider 
too 
what
breath
is  mere
air 
and
that
always
changing 
expelled
and
inhaled
again
every
moment 
the
third
is
the
ruling
part 
as
to
this 
take
heed 
now
that
you
are
old 
that
it
remain
no
longer
in
servitude 
that
it
be
no
more
dragged
hither
and
thither
like
a
puppet
by
every
selfish
impulse 
repine
no
more
at
what
fate
now
sends 
nor
dread
what
may
befall
you
hereafter 
  
whatever
the
gods
ordain
is
full
of
wise
forethought 
the
workings
of
chance
are
not
apart
from
nature 
and
not
without
connexion
and
intertexture
with
the
designs
of
providence 
providence
is
the
source
of
all
things 
and 
besides 
there
is
necessity 
and
the
utility
of
the
universe 
of
which
you
are
a
part 
for 
to
every
part
of
a
being 
that
is
good
which
springs
from
the
nature
of
the
whole
and
tends
to
its
preservation 
now 
the
order
of
nature
is
preserved
in
the
changes
of
elements 
just
as
it
is
in
the
changes
of
things
that
are
compound 
let
this
suffice
you 
and
be
your
creed
unchangeable 
put
from
you
the
thirst
of
books 
that
you
may
not
die
murmuring 
but
meekly 
and
with
true
and
heartfelt
gratitude
to
the
gods 
  
think
of
your
long
procrastination 
and
of
the
many
opportunities
given
you
by
the
gods 
but
left
unused 
surely
it
is
high
time
to
understand
the
universe
of
which
you
are
a
part 
and
the
ruler
of
that
universe 
of
whom
you
are
an
emanation 
that
a
limit
is
set
to
your
days 
which 
if
you
use
them
not
for
your
enlightenment 
will
depart 
as
you
yourself
will 
and
return
no
more 
  
hourly
and
earnestly
strive 
as
a
roman
and
a
man 
to
do
what
falls
to
your
hand
with
perfect
unaffected
dignity 
with
kindliness 
freedom
and
justice 
and
free
your
soul
from
every
other
imagination 
this
you
will
accomplish
if
you
perform
each
action
as
if
it
were
your
last 
without
wilfulness 
or
any
passionate
aversion
to
what
reason
approves 
without
hypocrisy
or
selfishness 
or
discontent
with
the
decrees
of
providence 
you
see
how
few
things
it
is
necessary
to
master
in
order
that
a
man
may
live
a
smooth flowing 
god fearing
life 
for
of
him
that
holds
to
these
principles
the
gods
require
no
more 
  
go
on 
go
on 
o
my
soul 
to
affront
and
dishonour
thyself 
the
time
that
remains
to
honour
thyself
will
not
be
long 
short
is
the
life
of
every
man 
and
thine
is
almost
spent 
spent 
not
honouring
thyself 
but
seeking
thy
happiness
in
the
souls
of
other
men 
  
cares
from
without
distract
you 
take
leisure 
then 
to
add
some
good
thing
to
your
knowledge 
have
done
with
vacillation 
and
avoid
the
other
error 
for
triflers 
too 
are
they
who 
by
their
activities 
weary
themselves
in
life 
and
have
no
settled
aim
to
which
they
may
direct 
once
and
for
all 
their
every
desire
and
project 
  
seldom
are
any
found
unhappy
from
not
observing
what
is
in
the
minds
of
others 
but
such
as
observe
not
well
the
stirrings
of
their
own
souls
must
of
necessity
be
unhappy 
  
remember
always
what
the
nature
of
the
universe
is 
what
your
own
nature
is 
and
how
these
are
related  the
one
to
the
other 
remember
what
part
your
qualities
are
of
the
qualities
of
the
whole 
and
that
no
man
can
prevent
you
from
speaking
and
acting
always
in
accordance
with
that
nature
of
which
you
are
a
part 
   
in
comparing
crimes
together 
as 
according
to
the
common
idea 
they
may
be
compared 
theophrastus
makes
the
true
philosophical
distinction 
that
those
committed
from
motives
of
pleasure
are
more
heinous
than
those
which
are
due
to
passion 
for
he
who
is
a
prey
to
passion
is
clearly
turned
away
from
reason
by
some
spasm
and
convulsion
that
takes
him
unawares 
but
he
who
sins
from
desire
is
conquered
by
pleasure 
and
so
seems
more
incontinent
and
more
effeminate
in
his
vice 
justly
then 
and
in
a
truly
philosophical
spirit 
he
says
that
sin 
for
pleasure s
sake 
is
more
wicked
than
sin
which
is
due
to
pain 
for
the
latter
sinner
was
sinned
against 
and
so
driven
to
passion
by
his
wrongs 
while
the
former
set
out
to
sin
of
his
own
motion 
and
was
led
into
ill doing
by
his
own
lust 
   
do
every
deed 
speak
every
word 
think
every
thought
in
the
knowledge
that
you
may
end
your
days
any
moment 
to
depart
from
men 
if
there
be
really
gods 
is
nothing
terrible 
the
gods
could
bring
no
evil
thing
upon
you 
and
if
there
be
no
gods 
or
if
they
have
no
regard
to
human
affairs 
why
should
i
desire
to
live
in
a
world
void
of
gods
and
without
providence 
but
gods
there
are 
and
assuredly
they
regard
human
affairs 
and
they
have
put
it
wholly
in
man s
power
that
he
should
not
fall
into
what
is
truly
evil 
and
of
other
things 
had
any
been
bad 
they
would
have
made
provision
also
that
man
should
have
the
power
to
avoid
them
altogether 
for
how
can
that
make
a
man s
life
worse
which
does
not
corrupt
the
man
himself 
presiding
nature
could
not
in
ignorance 
or
in
knowledge
impotent 
have
omitted
to
prevent
or
rectify
these
things 
she
could
not
fail
us
so
completely
that 
either
from
want
of
power
or
want
of
skill 
good
and
evil
should
happen
promiscuously
to
good
men
and
to
bad
alike 
now
death
and
life 
glory
and
reproach 
pain
and
pleasure 
riches
and
poverty  all
these
happen
equally
to
the
good
and
to
the
bad 
but 
as
they
are
neither
honourable
nor
shameful 
they
are
therefore
neither
good
nor
evil 
   
it
is
the
office
of
our
rational
power
to
apprehend
how
swiftly
all
things
vanish 
how
the
corporeal
forms
are
swallowed
up
in
the
material
world 
and
the
memory
of
them
in
the
tide
of
ages 
such
are
all
the
things
of
sense 
especially
those
which
ensnare
us
with
pleasure
or
terrify
us
with
pain 
or
those
things
which
vanity
trumpets
in
our
ears 
how
mean 
how
despicable 
how
sordid 
how
perishable 
how
dead
are
they 
what
are
they
whose
opinions
and
whose
voices
bestow
renown 
what
is
it
to
die 
your
mind
can
tell
you
that 
did
a
man
think
of
it
alone 
and 
by
close
consideration 
strip
it
of
its
ghastly
trappings 
he
would
no
longer
deem
it
anything
but
a
work
of
nature 
to
dread
a
work
of
nature
is
a
childish
thing 
and
this
is 
indeed 
not
only
nature s
work 
but
beneficial
to
her 
your
reason
tells
you
how
man
reaches
god 
and
through
what
part 
and
what
is
the
state
of
that
part 
when
he
has
attained
unto
him 
   
nothing 
says
the
poet 
is
more
miserable
than
to
range
over
all
things 
to
spy
into
the
depths
of
the
earth 
and
search 
by
conjecture 
into
the
souls
of
those
around
us 
yet
not
to
perceive
that
it
is
enough
for
a
man
to
devote
himself
to
that
divinity
which
is
within
him 
and
to
pay
it
genuine
worship 
and
this
worship
consists
in
keeping
it
pure
from
every
passion
and
folly 
and
from
repining
at
anything
done
by
gods
or
men 
the
work
of
the
gods
is
to
be
reverenced
for
its
excellence 
the
works
of
men
should
be
dear
for
the
sake
of
the
bond
of
kinship 
or
pitied 
as
we
must
pity
them
sometimes 
for
their
lack
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil 
and
men
are
not
less
maimed
by
this
defect
than
by
their
want
of
power
to
know
white
from
black 
   
though
you
should
live
three
thousand
ears
or
as
many
myriads 
yet
remember
that
no
man
loses
any
other
life
than
that
which
now
lives 
nor
lives
any
other
than
that
which
he
is
now
losing 
the
longest
and
the
shortest
lives
come
to
one
effect 
the
present
moment
is
the
same
for
all
men 
and
their
loss 
therefore 
is
equal 
for
it
is
clear
that
what
they
lose
in
death
is
but
a
fleeting
instant
of
time 
no
man
can
lose
either
the
past
or
the
future 
for
how
can
a
man
be
deprived
of
what
he
has
not 
these
two
things
then
are
to
be
remembered 
first 
that
all
things
recur
in
cycles 
and
are
the
same
from
everlasting 
and
that 
therefore 
it
matters
nothing
whether
a
man
shall
contemplate
these
same
things
for
one
hundred
years 
or
for
two
hundred 
or
for
an
infinite
stretch
of
time 
and 
secondly 
that
he
who
lives
longest
and
he
who
dies
soonest
have
an
equal
loss
in
death 
the
present
moment
is
all
of
which
either
is
deprived 
since
that
is
all
he
has 
no
man
can
be
robbed
of
that
which
he
has
not 
   
beyond
opinion
there
is
nothing 
the
objections
to
this
saying
of
monimus
the
cynic
are
obvious 
but
obvious
also
is
the
utility
of
what
he
said 
if
one
accept
his
pleasantry
as
far
as
truth
will
warrant
it 
   
man s
soul
dishonours
itself 
firstly
and
chiefly
when
it
does
all
it
can
to
become
an
excrescence 
and
as
it
were
an
abscess
on
the
universe 
to
fret
against
any
particular
event
is
to
revolt
against
the
general
law
of
nature 
which
comprehends
the
order
of
all
events
whatsoever 
again
it
is
dishonour
for
the
soul
when
it
has
aversion
to
any
man 
and
opposes
him
with
intention
to
hurt
him 
as
wrathful
men
do 
thirdly 
it
affronts
itself
when
conquered
by
pleasure
or
pain 
fourthly 
when
it
does
or
says
anything
hypocritically 
feignedly
or
falsely 
fifthly 
when
it
does
not
direct
to
some
proper
end
all
its
desires
and
actions 
but
exerts
them
inconsiderately
and
without
understanding 
for 
even
the
smallest
things
should
be
referred
to
the
end 
and
the
end
of
rational
beings
is
to
follow
the
order
and
law
of
the
venerable
state
and
polity
which
comprehends
them
all 
   
the
duration
of
man s
life
is
but
an
instant 
his
substance
is
fleeting 
his
senses
dull 
the
structure
of
his
body
corruptible 
the
soul
but
a
vortex 
we
cannot
reckon
with
fortune 
or
lay
our
account
with
fame 
in
fine 
the
life
of
the
body
is
but
a
river 
and
the
life
of
the
soul
a
misty
dream 
existence
is
a
warfare 
and
a
journey
in
a
strange
land 
and
the
end
of
fame
is
to
be
forgotten 
what
then
avails
to
guide
us 
one
thing 
and
one
alone  philosophy 
and
this
consists
in
keeping
the
divinity
within
inviolate
and
intact 
victorious
over
pain
and
pleasure 
free
from
temerity 
free
from
falsehood 
free
from
hypocrisy 
independent
of
what
others
do
or
fail
to
do 
submissive
to
hap
and
lot 
which
come
from
the
same
source
as
we 
and 
above
all 
with
equanimity
awaiting
death 
as
nothing
else
than
a
resolution
of
the
elements
of
which
every
being
compounded 
and 
if
in
their
successive
interchanges
no
harm
befall
the
elements 
why
should
one
suspect
any
in
the
change
and
dissolution
of
the
whole 
it
is
natural 
and
nothing
natural
can
be
evil 
  
man
must
consider 
not
only
that
each
day
part
of
his
life
is
spent 
and
that
less
and
less
remains
to
him 
but
also
that 
even
if
he
live
longer 
it
is
very
uncertain
whether
his
intelligence
will
suffice
as
heretofore
for
the
understanding
of
his
affairs 
and
for
grasping
that
knowledge
which
aims
at
comprehending
things
human
and
divine 
when
dotage
begins 
breath 
nourishment 
fancy 
impulse 
and
so
forth
will
not
fail
him 
but
self command 
accurate
appreciation
of
duty 
power
to
scrutinize
what
strikes
his
senses 
or
even
to
decide
whether
he
should
take
his
departure 
all
powers 
indeed 
which
demand
a
well trained
understanding 
must
be
extinguished
in
him 
let
him
be
up
and
doing
then 
not
only
because
death
comes
nearer
every
day 
but
because
understanding
and
intelligence
often
leave
us
before
we
die 
  
observe
what
grace
and
charm
appear
even
in
the
accidents
that
accompany
nature s
work 
thus
some
parts
of
a
loaf
crack
and
burst
in
the
baking 
and
this
cracking 
though
in
a
manner
contrary
to
the
design
of
the
baker 
looks
well
and
invites
the
appetite 
figs 
too 
gape
when
at
their
ripest 
and
in
ripe
olives
the
very
approach
to
rotting
adds
a
special
beauty
to
the
fruit 
the
droop
of
ears
of
corn 
the
bent
brows
of
the
lion 
the
foam
at
a
boar s
mouth 
and
many
other
things 
are
far
from
comely
in
themselves 
yet 
since
they
accompany
the
works
of
nature 
they
make
part
of
her
adornment 
and
rejoice
the
beholder 
thus 
if
a
man
be
sensitive
to
such
things 
and
have
a
more
than
common
penetration
into
the
constitution
of
the
whole 
scarce
anything
connected
with
nature
will
fail
to
give
him
pleasure 
as
he
comes
to
understand
it 
such
a
man
will
contemplate
in
the
real
world
the
fierce
jaws
of
wild
beasts
with
no
less
delight
than
when
sculptors
or
painters
set
forth
for
him
their
presentments

divert
you
from

you

shun
all

above
all 
everything

yourself

that 
if
any

were

ask
you 
 of
what
are
you
thinking now  
you
could
answer
frankly

at

so
and
so  
then
it
will
plainly
appear
that
you
are
all
simplicity

a

has
finally
determined
to
be
henceforth
among
the
best 
is 
as
it
were 
a
priest
and
minister
of
the
gods 
using
the
spirit
within
him 
which
preserves
a
man
unspotted

appointed
to
every

is
part
of
the
law
of
all
things
as
well
as
a
law
for
him 
he
forgets
not
that
all
rational
beings
are
akin 
and
that
the
love
of
all
mankind
is
part
of
the
nature
of
man 
also
that
we
must
not
think
as
all
men

but
only
as
those
who
live
a

with
nature

for

he
remembers
always
how
they
act
at

and
abroad 
by
night
and
by

and
how
and
with
whom
they
are
found
in
company

so
he
cannot
esteem
the
praise
of
such 
for
they
enjoy
not

neither
grudging 
nor
selfish 
nor

nor
constrained 
let
not
your
thought
be
adorned
with
overmuch
nicety 
be
not
a
babbler
or
a
busybody 
let
the
god
within
direct
you
as
a
manly
being 
as
an
elder 
a
statesman 
a
roman 
and
a
ruler 
standing
prepared
like
one
who
awaits
the
recall
from
life 
in
marching
order 
requiring
neither
an
oath
nor
the
testimony
of
any
man 
and
withal 
be
cheerful 
and
independent
of
the
assistance
and
the
peace
that
comes
from
others 
for 
it
is
a
man s
duty
to
stand
upright 
self supporting 
not
supported 
  
if
in
the
life
of
man
you
find
anything
better
than
justice 
truth 
sobriety 
manliness 
and 
in
sum 
anything
better
than
the
satisfaction
of
your
soul
with
itself
in
that
wherein
it
is
given
to
you
to
follow
right
reason 
and
with
fate
in
that
which
is
determined
beyond
your
control 
if 
i
say 
you
find
aught
better
than
this 
then
turn
thereto
with
all
your
heart 
and
enjoy
it
as
the
best
that
is
to
be
found 
but
if
nothing
seems
to
you
better
than
the
divinity
seated
within
you 
which
has
conquered
all
your
impulses 
which
sifts
all
your
thoughts 
which 
as
socrates
said 
has
detached
itself
from
the
promptings
of
sense 
and
devoted
itself
to
god
and
to
the
love
of
mankind 
if
you
find
every
other
thing
small
and
worthless
compared
with
this 
see
that
you
give
place
to
no
other
which
might
turn 
divert 
or
distract
you
from
holding
in
highest
esteem
the
good
which
is
especially
and
properly
your
own 
for
it
is
not
permitted
to
us
to
substitute
for
that
which
is
good
in
reason
or
in
fact
anything
not
agreeable
thereto 
such
as
the
praise
of
the
many 
power 
riches 
or
the
pursuit
of
pleasure 
all
these
things
may
seem
admissible
for
a
moment 
but
presently
they
get
the
upper
hand 
and
lead
us
astray 
but
do
you 
i
say 
frankly
and
freely
choose
the
best 
and
keep
to
it 
the
best
is
what
is
for
your
advantage 
if
now
you
choose
what
is
for
your
spiritual
advantage 
hold
it
fast 
if
what
is
for
your
bodily
advantage 
admit
that
it
is
so
chosen 
and
keep
your
choice
with
all
modesty 
only
see
that
you
make
a
sure
discrimination 
  
never
esteem
aught
of
advantage
which
will
oblige
you
to
break
your
faith 
or
to
desert
your
honour 
to
hate 
to
suspect 
or
to
execrate
any
man 
to
play
a
part 
or
to
set
your
mind
on
anything
that
needs
to
be
hidden
by
wall
or
curtain 
he
who
to
all
things
prefers
the
soul 
the
divinity
within
him 
and
the
sacred
cult
of
its
virtues 
makes
no
tragic
groan
or
gesture 
he
needs
neither
solitude
nor
a
crowd
of
spectators 
and 
best
of
all 
he
will
live
neither
seeking
nor
shunning
death 
whether
the
soul
shall
use
its
surrounding
body
for
a
longer
or
shorter
space
is
to
him
indifferent 
were
he
to
depart
this
moment
he
would
go
as
readily
as
he
would
do
any
other
seemly
and
proper
action 
holding
one
thing
only
in
life long
avoidance  to
find
his
soul
in
any
case
unbefitting
an
intelligent
social
being 
  
in
the
soul
of
the
chastened
and
purified
man
you
would
find
nothing
putrid 
foul 
or
festering 
fate
does
not
cut
off
his
life
before
its
proper
end 
as
one
would
say
of
an
actor
who
left
the
stage
before
his
part
was
ended 
or
he
had
reached
his
appointed
exit 
there
remains
nothing
servile
or
affected 
nothing
too
conventional
or
too
seclusive 
nothing
that
fears
censure
or
courts
concealment 
  
hold
in
honour
the
faculty
which
forms
opinions 
it
depends
on
this
faculty
alone
that
no
opinion
your
soul
entertains
be
inconsistent
with
the
nature
and
constitution
of
the
rational
being 
it
ensures
that
we
form
no
rash
judgments 
that
we
are
kindly
to
men 
and
obedient
to
the
gods 
   
cast
from
you
then
all
other
things 
retaining
these
few 
remember
also
that
every
man
lives
only
this
present
moment 
which
is
a
fleeting
instant 
the
rest
of
time
is
either
spent
or
quite
unknown 
short
is
the
time
which
each
of
us
has
to
live 
and
small
the
corner
of
the
earth
he
has
to
live
in 
short
is
the
longest
posthumous
fame 
and
this
preserved
through
a
succession
of
poor
mortals 
soon
themselves
to
die 
men
who
knew
not
themselves 
far
less
those
who
died
long
ago 
   
to
these
maxims
add
this
other 
accurately
define
or
describe
every
thing
that
strikes
your
imagination 
so
that
you
may
see
and
distinguish
what
it
is
in
naked
essence 
and
what
it
is
in
its
entirety 
that
you
may
tell
yourself
the
proper
name
of
the
thing
itself 
and
the
names
of
the
parts
of
which
it
is
compounded 
and
into
which
it
will
be
resolved 
nothing
makes
mind
greater
than
the
power
to
enquire
into
all
things
that
present
themselves
in
life 
and 
while
you
examine
them 
to
consider
at
the
same
time
of
what
fashion
is
the
universe 
and
what
is
the
function
in
it
of
these
things 
of
what
importance
they
are
to
the
whole 
of
what
to
man
who
is
a
citizen
of
that
highest
city
of
which
all
other
cities
are
but
households 
consider
what
is
this
thing
that
now
makes
an
impression
on
you 
of
what
it
is
composed 
and
how
long
it
is
destined
to
endure 
consider
also
for
what
virtue
it
calls 
whether
it
be
gentleness 
courage 
truthfulness 
fidelity 
simplicity 
independence 
or
any
other 
say 
therefore 
of
each
event 
 this
comes
from
god  
or
 this
comes
from
the
conjunction
and
intertexture
of
the
strands
of
fate 
or
from
some
chance
or
hazard
of
that
kind  
or
 this
comes
from
one
of
my
own
tribe 
from
my
kinsman 
from
my
friend 
he
is 
indeed 
ignorant
of
what
accords
with
nature 
but
i
am
not 
and
will
therefore
use
him
kindly
and
justly 
according
to
the
natural
and
social
law 
as
to
things
indifferent 
i
strive
to
appraise
them
at
their
proper
value  
   
if
you
discharge
your
present
duty
with
firm
and
zealous 
yet
kindly 
observance
of
the
laws
of
reason 
if
you
regard
no
by gains 
but
keep
pure
within
you
your
immortal
part 
as
if
obliged
to
restore
it
at
once
to
him
who
gave
it 
if
you
hold
to
this
with
no
further
desires
or
aversions 
and
be
content
with
the
natural
discharge
of
your
present
task 
and
with
the
heroic
sincerity
of
all
you
say
or
utter 
you
will
live
well 
and
herein
no
man
can
hinder
you 
   
as
surgeons
have
ever
their
knives
and
instruments
at
hand
for
the
sudden
emergencies
of
their
art 
so
do
you
keep
ready
the
principles
requisite
for
understanding
things
divine
and
human 
and
for
doing
all
things 
even
the
least
important 
in
the
remembrance
of
the
bond
between
the
two 
for
in
neglecting
this 
you
will
scant
your
duty
both
to
gods
and
men 
   
cease
your
wandering 
for
you
are
not
like
to
read
again
your
own
memoirs 
or
the
deeds
of
the
ancient
greeks
and
romans 
or
those
collections
from
the
writings
of
others
that
you
laid
up
for
your
old
age 
hasten
then
to
your
proper
end 
fling
away
vain
hopes 
and 
if
you
have
any
care
for
yourself 
fly
to
your
own
succour
while
yet
you
may 
   
men
understand
not
all
that
is
signified
by
the
words  to
steal 
to
sow 
to
buy 
to
rest 
to
see
what
is
to
be
done 
for
it
is
not
the
bodily
eye
but
another
sort
of
sight
that
must
discern
these
things 
   
we
have
body 
soul 
and
intelligence 
to
the
body
belong
the
senses 
to
the
soul
the
passions 
to
the
intelligence
principles 
to
be
affected
by
the
imagery
of
sense
belongs
to
the
beasts
of
the
field
no
less
than
to
us 
to
be
swayed
by
gusts
of
passion
is
common
to
us
with
the
wild
beasts 
with
the
most
effeminate
wretches 
with
nero
and
with
phalaris 
moreover 
the
possession
of
a
mind
to
guide
us
to
what
seems
fitting
is
shared
by
us 
with
atheists 
with
traitors
to
their
country 
and
with
such
as
shut
their
doors
and
sin 
if 
then 
all
the
rest
is
common
as
we
have
seen 
there
remains
to
the
good
man
this
special
excellence 
to
welcome
with
pleasure
all
that
happens
or
is
ordained 
not
to
defile
the
divinity
enthroned
in
his
breast 
not
to
perturb
it
with
a
crowd
of
images 
but
to
preserve
it
in
tranquillity 
and
obey
it
as
a
god 
to
observe
truth
in
all
he
says 
and
justice
in
his
every
action 
and
though
others
may
not
believe
that
he
lives
thus
in
simplicity 
modesty 
and
contentment 
he
neither
takes
this
unbelief
amiss
from
any
one 
nor
quits
the
road
which
leads
to
the
true
end
of
life 
at
which
he
ought
to
arrive
pure 
calm 
ready
to
take
his
departure 
and
accommodated
without
compulsion
to
his
fate 
  
the
power
which
rules
within
us 
when
its
state
is
accordant
with
nature 
so
acts
in
every
occurrence
as
easily
to
adapt
itself
to
all
present
or
possible
situations 
it
requires
no
set
material
to
work
upon 
but 
under
proper
reservation 
needs
but
the
incitement
to
pursue 
and
makes
matter
for
its
activities
out
of
every
opposition 
even
so
a
fire
masters
that
which
is
cast
upon
it 
and
though
a
small
flame
would
have
been
extinguished 
your
great
blaze
quickly
makes
the
added
fuel
its
own 
consumes
it 
and
grows
mightier
therefrom 
  
let
no
action
be
done
at
random 
nor
otherwise
than
in
complete
accordance
with
the
principles
involved 
  
men
seek
retirement
in
the
country 
on
the
sea coast 
in
the
mountains 
and
you
too
have
frequent
longings
for
such
distractions 
yet
surely
this
is
great
folly 
since
you
may
retire
into
yourself
at
any
hour
you
please 
nowhere
can
a
man
find
any
retreat
more
quiet
and
more
full
of
leisure
than
in
his
own
soul 
especially
when
there
is
that
within
it
on
which 
if
he
but
look 
he
is
straightway
quite
at
rest 
and
rest
i
hold
to
be
naught
else
but
perfect
order
in
the
soul 
constantly 
therefore 
allow
yourself
this
retirement 
and
so
renew
yourself 
have
also
at
hand
thoughts
brief
and
fundamental 
which
readily
may
occur 
sufficing
to
shut
out
the
discordant
clamour
of
the
world 
and
to
send
you
back
without
fretting
at
the
task
to
which
you
return 
for
at
what
do
you
fret 
at
the
wickedness
of
mankind 
recollect
the
maxim
that
all
reasoning
beings
are
created
for
one
another 
that
to
bear
with
them
is
a
part
of
justice 
and
that
they
cannot
help
their
sin 
remember
how
many
of
those
who
lived
in
enmity 
suspicion 
and
hatred 
at
daggers
drawn 
have
been
stretched
on
their
funeral
pyres 
and
turned
to
ashes 
remember
and
cease
from
your
complaints 
is
it
your
allotted
part
in
the
world s
destiny
that
chagrins
you 
be
calm 
and
renew
your
knowledge
of
the
alternative 
that
 either
providence
directs
the
world 
or
there
is
nothing
but
unguided
atoms  
and
recollect
the
many
proofs
that
the
universe
is
as
it
were
a
state 
do
the
ills
of
the
body
still
have
power
to
touch
you 
reflect
that
the
mind 
once
withdrawn
within
itself 
once
grown
conscious
of
its
own
power 
has
no
concern
with
the
motions 
rough
or
smooth 
of
the
breathing
body 
remember 
too 
all
that
you
have
heard
and
assented
to
concerning
pain
and
pleasure 
are
you
distracted
by
the
poor
thing
called
fame 
think
how
swiftly
all
things
are
forgotten 
behold
the
chaos
of
eternity
which
besets
us
on
either
side 
think
how
empty
is
the
noisy
echo
of
acclamation 
how
fickle
and
how
scant
of
judgment
are
they
who
would
seem
to
praise
us 
and
how
narrow
the
bounds
within
which
their
praise
is
confined 
all
the
earth
is
but
a
point
in
the
universe 
how
small
a
corner
of
that
little
is
inhabited 
and
even
there
how
few
are
they
and
of
how
little
worth
who
are
to
praise
us 
remember
then
that
there
ever
remains
for
you
retirement
into
the
little
field
within 
and 
above
all 
be
neither
distraught
nor
overstrained 
hold
fast
your
freedom 
consider
all
things
as
a
man
of
courage 
as
a
human
being 
as
a
citizen 
as
a
mortal 
readiest
among
the
principles
to
which
you
look
let
there
be
these
two 
firstly 
things
external
do
not
touch
the
soul 
but
remain
powerless
without 
and
all
trouble
comes
from
what
we
think
of
them
within 
secondly 
all
things
visible
change
in
a
moment 
and
are
gone
for
ever 
recollect
all
the
changes
of
which
you
have
yourself
been
a
witness 
the
world
is
a
succession
of
changes 
life
is
but
thought 
  
if
mind
be
common
to
us
all 
the
reason
in
virtue
of
which
we
are
rational
is
also
common 
so
too
is
the
power
which
bids
us
do
or
not
do 
therefore
we
have
all
a
common
law 
and
if
so 
we
are
fellow citizens
and
members
of
some
common
polity 
the
universe 
then 
must
in
a
manner
be
a
state 
for
of
what
other
common
polity
can
all
mankind
be
said
to
be
members 
wherefore
it
is
from
this
common
state
that
we
derive
our
intellectual
power 
our
reason 
and
our
law 
or
whence
do
we
derive
them 
for
that
which
is
earthy
in
me
is
derived
from
earth 
my
moisture
from
some
other
element 
my
breath
and
what
is
warm
or
fiery
from
their
proper
sources 
and
therefore 
as
nothing
can
arise
from
nothing
or
return
thereto 
my
intellectual
part
has
also
a
source 
  
death 
like
birth 
is
a
mystery
of
nature 
the
one
a
compounding
of
elements 
the
other
a
resolution
into
the
same 
in
neither
is
there
anything
shameful
or
against
the
nature
of
the
rational
animal 
or
contrary
to
the
law
of
its
constitution 
  
it
is
fate
that
such
actions
should
come
from
such
men 
he
who
would
have
it
otherwise
would
have
figs
without
juice 
this 
too 
you
should
remember 
that
in
a
very
short
time
both
you
and
he
must
die 
and
a
little
after
not
even
the
name
of
either
shall
remain 
  
suppress
the
thought 
and
the
cry
 i
am
hurt  
is
gone 
suppress
 i
am
hurt  
and
you
suppress
the
injury 
  
what
makes
not
a
man
worse
than
he
was 
makes
not
his
life
worse 
nor
hurts
him
without
or
within 
  
the
law
of
utility
must
act
so 
   
all
that
happens 
happens
right 
you
will
find
it
so
if
you
observe
narrowly 
i
mean
not
only
according
to
a
natural
order 
but
according
to
our
idea
of
justice 
and 
as
it
were 
by
the
action
of
one
who
distributes
according
to
merit 
go
on
then
observing
this
as
you
have
begun 
and
whatever
you
do 
let
your
aim
be
goodness 
goodness
as
it
is
rightly
understood 
hold
to
this
in
every
action 
   
think
not
as
your
insulter
judges
or
wishes
you
to
judge 
but
see
things
as
they
truly
are 
   
for
two
things
be
ever
ready 
first 
to
do
that
only
which
reason 
the
sovereign
and
legislative
faculty 
suggests
for
the
good
of
mankind 
secondly 
to
change
your
course
on
meeting
any
one
who
can
correct
and
alter
your
opinion 
but
let
the
change
be
made
because
you
really
believe
it
to
be
in
the
interest
of
justice
or
the
public
good 
or
such
like 
and
not
with
any
view
to
pleasure
or
glory
for
yourself 
   
have
you
reason 
i
have 
why
then
do
you
not
use
it 
when
it
performs
its
proper
office
what
more
do
you
require 
   
you
exist
as
part
of
a
whole 
you
will
disappear
again
in
that
which
produced
you 
or
rather
you
will
change
and
be
resumed
again
into
the
productive
intelligence 
   
many

on

it
makes
no

within
ten
days 
if
you
return
to
the
observance
of
moral
principles
and
to
the
cult
of
reason 
you
will
appear
a
god
to
them
who
now
esteem
you
a

how
much
he
gains
in
leisure
who
looks
not
to
what
his
neighbours
say 
or
do 
or
intend 
but
considers
only
how
his
own
actions
may
be
just
and
holy 
looking
not 
as
agathon
says 
to
the
moral
example
of
others 
but
running
a
straight
course
and
never
turning
therefrom 
   
he
who
is
careful
and
troubled
about
the
fame
which
is
to
live
after
him
considers
not
that
each
one
of
those
who
remember
him
must
very
soon
die
himself 
and
thereafter
also
the
succeeding
generation 
until
every
memory
of
him 
handed
on
by
excited
and
ephemeral
admirers 
dies
utterly
away 
grant
that
your
memory
were
immortal 
and
those
immortal
who
retain
it 
yet
what
is
that
to
you 
i
ask
not 
what
is
that
to
the
dead 
but
to
the
living
what
is
the
profit
in
praise 
except
it
be
in
some
convenience
that
it
brings 
and
you
now
abandon
what
nature
has
put
in
your
power
in
order
to
set
your
hopes
upon
the
report
of
others 
   
whatever
is
beautiful
at
all
is
beautiful
in
itself 
its
beauty
ends
there 
and
praise
has
no
part
in
it 
nothing
is
the
better
or
the
worse
for
being
praised 
and
this
holds
also
of
what
is
beautiful
in
the
common
estimation 
of
material
forms
and
works
of
art 
thus
true
beauty
needs
nothing
beyond
itself 
any
more
than
law 
or
truth 
or
kindness 
or
honour 
for
none
of
these
gets
a
single
grace
from
praise
or
one
blot
from
censure 
does
the
emerald
lose
its
virtue
if
one
praise
it
not 
can
one
by
scanting
praise
depreciate
gold 
ivory 
or
purple 
a
lyre
or
a
dagger 
a
flower
or
a
shrub 
   
if
our
souls
survive
us 
how 
you
ask 
has
the
air
contained
them
from
eternity 
how 
i
answer 
does
the
earth
contain
so
many
bodies
buried
during
so
long
a
time 
just
as
corpses 
after
remaining
for
a
while
in
the
earth 
change 
and
are
dissipated
to
make
room
for
others 
so
also
the
souls 
liberated
into
air 
remain
for
a
little 
and
then
are
changed 
diffused 
rekindled 
and
resumed
into
the
universal
productive
spirit 
and
so
give
way
to
others
who
come
to
take
their
places 
this
may
serve
for
an
answer 
on
the
supposition
that
the
soul
survives
the
body 
but
we
have
not
merely
to
consider
the
number
of
bodies
thus
buried
in
the
earth 
there
are
also
all
the
living
creatures
eaten
day
by
day
by
ourselves
and
other
animals 
how
great
a
multitude
of
them
is
thus
consumed 
and
as
it
were
buried
in
the
bodies
of
those
who
feed
upon
them 
yet
there
is
ever
space
to
contain
them 
owing
to
the
changes
into
blood 
air 
and
fire 
what 
then 
is
the
key
to
this
enquiry 
discrimination
of
matter
and
cause 
   
swerve
not
from
your
path 
in
every
impulse
render
justice
its
due 
and
in
all
thinking
be
sure
that
you
understand 
   
i
am
in
tune
with
all
that
is
of
thy
harmony 
o
nature 
for
me
nothing
is
too
early
and
nothing
is
too
late
that
comes
in
thy
good
time 
all
is
fruit
to
me 
o
nature 
that
thy
seasons
bring 
from
thee
are
all
things 
thou
comprehendest
all 
and
all
returns
to
thee

 do
few
things  
says
the
philosopher 
 if
you
would
have
quiet  
this
is
perhaps
a
better
saying 
 do
what
is
necessary 
do
what
the
reason
of
the
being
that
is
social
in
its
nature
directs 
and
do
it
in
the
spirit
of
that
direction  
by
this
you
will
attain
the
calm
that
comes
from
virtuous
action 
and
that
calm
also
which
comes
from
having
few
things
to
do 
most
things
you
say
and
do
are
not
necessary 
have
done
with
them 
and
you
will
be
more
at
leisure
and
less
perturbed 
on
every
occasion 
then 
ask
yourself
the
question 
is
this
thing
not
unnecessary 
and
put
away
not
only
unnecessary
deeds
but
unnecessary
thoughts 
for
by
so
doing
you
will
avoid
all
superfluous
actions 
   
make
trial
how
the
life
of
a
good
man
succeeds
with
you 
the
life
of
one
who
is
content
with
the
lot
appointed
him
by
providence 
and
satisfied
with
the
justice
of
his
own
actions
and
the
benevolence
of
his
disposition 
   
you

all

that

consider 
likewise 
the
records

nations

see
how 
after
their
fit
of
eagerness 
all
quickly
fell 
and
were
resolved
into
the
elements 
but
most
of
all 
remember
those
whom
you
yourself
have
known 
men
who
were
distracted
about
vain
things 
men
who
neglected
the
course
which
suited
their
own
nature 
neither
holding
fast
to
it
nor
finding
their
contentment
there 
and 
herein

not
that
care
is
to
be
bestowed
on
any
enterprise
only
in
proportion
to
its
proper
worth 
for
if
you
keep
this
in
mind
you
will
not
be
disheartened
from
over
concern
with
things
of
less
account 
   
the
familiar
phrases
of
old
days
are
now
strange
and

of

who

with
the
brightness
of
their

the
rest
of
men 
as
soon
as
they
expire

for
this
alone 
that
our

be
just 
our
actions
unselfish 
our
speech
ever
sincere 
and
our
disposition
such
as
may
cheerfully
embrace
whatever
happens 
seeing
it
to
be

from

both
what
remembers
and
what
is
remembered 
   
observe
continually
that
all
things
exist
in
change 
and
keep
this
thought
ever
with
you 
that
nature
loves
nothing
more
than
changing
what
things
now
are 
and
making
others
like
them 
for
what
now
is 
is
in
a
manner
the
seed
of
what
shall
be 
therefore 
conceive
not
that
that
alone
is
seed
which
is
cast
into
the
earth
or
the
womb 
for
that
is
the
thought
of
ignorance 
   
you
are
presently
to
die 
and
yet
you
have
not
attained
to
simplicity
or
calm 
or
to
disbelief
that
you
can
be
hurt
by
things
external 
you
have
not
learned
to
be
kindly
to
all
men 
or
to
count
just
dealing
the
whole
of
wisdom 
   
scan
closely
that
which
governs
men 
see
what
are
their
cares 
and
what
they
pursue
or
shun 
   
that
which
is
evil
for
you
exists
not
in
the
soul
of
another 
nor
in
any
change
or
alteration
of
the
body
which
surrounds
you 
where 
then 
is
it 
it
lies
in
that
part
of
you
by
which
you
apprehend
what
evil
is 
stay
the
apprehension 
and
all
is
well 
and
though
the
poor
body
to
which
it
is
so
closely
bound
be
cut
and
burned 
though
it
suppurate
or
mortify 
yet
let
the
apprehension
remain
inactive 
that
is 
let
it
judge
nothing
either
bad
or
good
which
can
happen
equally
to
the
bad
man
and
to
the
good 
for
that
which
befalls
equally
him
who
lives
in
accord 
and
him
who
lives
in
discord
with
nature 
can
neither
be
natural
nor
unnatural 
   
ever
consider
this
universe
as
one
living
being 
with
one
material
substance
and
one
spirit 
observe
how
all
things
are
referred
to
the
one
intelligence
of
this
being 
how
all
things
act
on
one
impulse 
how
all
things
are
concurrent
causes
of
all
others 
and
how
all
things
are
connected
and
intertwined 
   
 thou
art
a
poor
soul 
saddled
with
a
corpse  
said
epictetus 
   
there
is
no
evil
for
things
which
subsist
in
change 
and
there
can
be
no
good
for
things
which
subsist
without
it 
   
time
is
a
river 
a
violent
torrent
of
things
coming
into
being 
each
one 
as
soon
as
it
has
appeared 
is
swept
away 
it
is
succeeded
by
another
which
is
swept
away
in
its
turn 
   
all
that
happens
is
as
natural
and
familiar
as
a
rose
in
spring 
or
fruit
in
summer 
such
are
disease
and
death 
calumny
and
treachery 
and
all
else
which
gives
fools
joy
or
sorrow 
   
consequents
follow
antecedents
by
virtue
of
a
special
and
necessary
connexion 
this
relation
is
not
that
which
exists
in
a
mere
enumeration
of
independent
things 
and
depends
merely
on
some
arbitrary
convention 
it
is
a
rational
relationship 
and
just
as
things
now
existing
are
ranged
harmoniously
together 
so
those
which
come
into
existence
display
no
bare
succession 
but
a
wonderful
harmony
with
what
preceded 
   
remember
always
the
sayings
of
heraclitus 
that
the
death
of
earth
is
to
become
water 
the
death
of
water
to
become
air 
and
the
death
of
air
to
become
fire 
and
so
conversely 
remember
in
what
a
case
he
is
who
forgets
whither
the
way
leads 
that
men
are
frequently
at
variance
with
their
close
and
constant
companion 
the
reason
which
rules
all 
that
men
count
strange
that
which
they
meet
every
day 
that
we
should
neither
act
nor
speak
as
though
in
slumber 
although
even
in
slumber
we
seem
to
act
and
speak 
nor
yet
like
children
learning
from
their
parents 
with
a
mere
acceptance
of
everything
just
as
we
are
told
it 
   
if
some
god
were
to
inform
you
that
you
must
die
tomorrow 
or
the
next
day
at
farthest 
you
would
take
little
concern
whether
it
was
to
be
tomorrow
or
the
next
day 
that
is
if
you
were
not
the
most
miserable
of
cowards 
for
how
small
is
the
difference 
wherefore 
account
it
of
no
great
moment
whether
you
die
after
many
years
or
tomorrow 
   
constantly
consider
how
many
physicians
are
dead
and
gone 
who
frequently
knitted
their
brows
over
their
patients 
how
many
astrologers 
who
foretold
the
deaths
of
others
with
great
ostentation
of
their
art 
how
many
philosophers 
who
wrote
endlessly
on
death
and
immortality 
how
many
warriors 
who
slew
their
thousands 
and
how
many
tyrants 
who
used
their
power
of
life
and
death
with
cruel
wantonness 
as
though
they
had
been
immortal 
how
many
whole
cities 
if
i
may
so
speak 
are
dead 
helice
and
pompeii
and
herculaneum 
and
others
past
counting 
tell
over
next
all
those
you
have
known 
one
after
the
other 
think
how
one
buried
his
fellow 
then
lay
dead
himself 
to
be
buried
by
a
third 
and
all
this
within
a
little
time 
in
sum 
look
upon
human
things 
and
behold
how
short lived
and
how
vile
they
are 
mucus
yesterday 
tomorrow
ashes
or
pickled
carrion 
spend 
then 
the
fleeting
remnant
of
your
time
in
a
spirit
that
accords
with
nature 
and
depart
contentedly 
so
the
olive
falls
when
it
is
grown
ripe 
blessing
the
ground
from
whence
it
sprung 
and
thankful
to
the
tree
that
bore
it 
   
be
like
a
promontory
against
which
the
waves
are
always
breaking 
it
stands
fast 
and
stills
the
waters
that
rage
around
it 
 wretched
am
i  
says
one 
 that
this
has
befallen
me  
 nay  
say
you 
 happy
am
i
who 
though
this
has
befallen
me 
can
still
remain
without
sorrow 
neither
broken
by
the
present
nor
dreading
the
future  
the
like
might
have
befallen
any
one 
but
every
one
would
not
have
endured
it
unpained 
why 
then 
should
we
dwell
more
on
the
misfortune
of
the
incident
than
on
the
felicity
of
such
strength
of
mind 
can
you
call
that
a
misfortune
for
a
man
which
is
not
a
miscarriage
of
his
nature 
and
can
you
call
anything
a
miscarriage
of
his
nature
which
is
not
contrary
to
its
purpose 
you
have
learned
its
purpose 
have
you
not 
then
does
this
accident
debar
you
from
justice 
magnanimity 
prudence 
wisdom 
caution 
truth 
honour 
freedom 
and
all
else
in
the
possession
of
which
man s
nature
finds
its
full
estate 
remember 
therefore 
for
the
future 
upon
all
occasions
of
sorrow 
to
use
the
maxim 
this
thing
is
not
misfortune 
but
to
bear
it
bravely
is
good
fortune 
   
it
is
a
vulgar
meditation 
and
yet
very
effectual
for
enabling
us
to
despise
death 
to
consider
the
fate
of
those
who
have
been
most
earnestly
tenacious
of
life 
and
enjoyed
it
longest 
wherein
is
their
gain
greater
than
that
of
those
who
died
before
their
time 
they
are
all
lying
dead
somewhere
or
other 
cadicianus 
fabius 
julian 
lepidus 
and
their
fellows 
saw
the
corpses
of
multitudes
carried
to
the
grave 
and
then
themselves
were
carried
thither 
in
sum 
how
small
was
the
difference
of
time 
spent
painfully
amid
what
troubles 
among
what
worthless
men 
and
in
how
mean
a
carcase 
think
it
not
a
thing
of
value 
rather
look
back
into
the
eternity
that
gapes
behind 
and
forward
into
the
other
abyss
of
immensity 
compared
with
such
infinity 
small
is
the
difference
between
a
life
of
three
days
and
one
of
three
ages
like
nestor s 
   
run
ever
the
short
way 
the
short
way
is
the
way
according
to
nature 
therefore
speak
and
act
according
to
the
soundest
rule 
for
this
resolution
will
free
you
from
much
toil
and
warring 
and
from
all
artful
management
and
ostentation 
  
in
the
morning 
when
you
find
yourself
unwilling
to
rise 
have
this
thought
at
hand 
i
arise
to
the
proper
business
of
man 
and
shall
i
repine
at
setting
about
that
work
for
which
i
was
born
and
brought
into
the
world 
am
i
equipped
for
nothing
but
to
lie
among
the
bed clothes
and
keep
warm 
 but  
you
say 
 it
is
more
pleasant
so  
is
pleasure 
then 
the
object
of
your
being 
and
not
action 
and
the
exercise
of
your
powers 
do
you
not
see
the
smallest
plants 
the
little
sparrows 
the
ants 
the
spiders 
the
bees 
all
doing
their
part 
and
working
for
order
in
the
universe 
as
far
as
in
them
lies 
and
will
you
refuse
the
part
in
this
design
which
is
laid
on
man 
will
you
not
pursue
the
course
which
accords
with
your
own
nature 
you
say 
 i
must
have
rest  
assuredly 
but
nature
appoints
a
measure
for
rest 
just
as
for
eating
and
drinking 
in
rest
you
go
beyond
these
limits 
and
beyond
what
is
enough 
but
in
action
you
do
not
fill
the
measure 
and
remain
well
within
your
powers 
you
do
not
love
yourself 
if
you
did 
you
would
love
your
nature
and
its
purpose 
others 
who
love
the
art
that
they
have
made
their
own 
exhaust
themselves
with
labouring
at
it
unwashed
and
unfed 
but
you
honour
your
own
nature
less
than
the
carver
honours
his
carving 
less
than
the
dancer
honours
his
dancing 
the
miser
his
gold 
or
the
vain
man
his
empty
fame 
these
men 
when
desire
takes
them 
count
food
and
sleep
well
lost
if
they
can
better
realize
the
object
of
their
longings 
and
shall
the
pursuit
of
the
common
good
seem
less
precious
in
your
eyes
and
worthy
of
a
lesser
zeal 
  
how
easy
it
is
to
thrust
away
and
blot
out
each
impression
that
is
disturbing
and
unfit 
and
forthwith
to
enjoy
perfect
tranquillity 
  
judge
no
speech
or
action
unworthy
of
you
which
is
consistent
with
nature 
be
not
dissuaded
by
any
consequent
criticism
or
censure
from
others 
but 
if
the
speech
or
action
be
honourable 
judge
yourself
worthy
to
say
or
do
it 
those
who
criticize
you
have
their
own
conscience
and
their
own
motives 
these
you
are
not
to
regard 
but
follow
a
straight
course 
guided
by
your
own
nature
and
the
nature
of
the
universe 
both
of
which
point
the
same
way 
  
i
walk
the
way
which
is
nature s 
until
at
last
i
shall
fall
and
be
at
rest 
breathing
out
my
breath
into
the
air
wherefrom
i
daily
drew
it 
falling
on
that
earth
whence
my
father
drew
his
seed 
my
mother
her
blood 
and
my
nurse
the
milk
which
nourished
me 
on
that
earth
which
has
given
me
my
daily
food
and
drink
through
all
these
years 
which
sustains
my
footsteps 
and
bears
with
me  her
manifold
abuser 
  
men
cannot
admire
you
for
your
shrewdness 
be
it
so 
but
there
is
many
another
quality
of
which
you
cannot
say 
 it
is
not
in
me  
display
these 
they
are
wholly
in
your
power 
be
sincere 
be
dignified 
be
painstaking 
scorn
pleasure 
repine
not
at
fate 
need
little 
be
kind
and
frank 
love
not
exaggeration
and
vain
talk 
strive
after
greatness 
do
you
not
see
how
many
virtues
you
might
show 
of
which
you
are
yet
content
to
fall
short 
though
you
have
not
the
excuse
that
they
are
absent 
or
that
you
are
unfit
for
them 
are
you
driven
by
some
want
in
your
equipment
to
be
querulous 
to
be
miserly 
to
be
a
flatterer 
to
reproach
your
body
with
your
own
faults 
to
cringe
to
others 
to
be
vainglorious 
to
have
all
this
restlessness
in
your
soul 
no 
by
the
gods 
you
might
have
escaped
these
vices
long
ago 
all
your
fault 
then 
is
that
you
are
somewhat
slow
and
dull
of
comprehension 
this
you
should
strive
to
correct
by
exercise 
neither
neglecting
your
dulness
nor
taking
a
mean
pleasure
in
it 
  
some
men 
when
they
have
done
you
a
favour 
are
very
ready
to
reckon
up
the
obligation
they
have
conferred 
others 
again 
are
not
so
forward
in
their
claims 
but
yet
in
their
minds
consider
you
their
debtor 
and
well
know
the
value
of
what
they
have
done 
a
third
sort
seem
to
be
unconscious
of
their
service 
they
are
like
the
vine 
which
produces
its
clusters
and
is
satisfied
when
it
has
yielded
its
proper
fruit 
the
horse
when
he
has
run
his
course 
the
hound
when
he
has
followed
the
track 
the
bee
when
it
has
made
its
honey 
and
the
man
when
he
has
done
good
to
others 
make
no
noisy
boast
of
it 
but
set
out
to
do
the
same
once
more 
as
the
vine
in
its
season
produces
its
new
clusters
again 
 should
we 
then 
be
among
those
who
in
a
manner
know
not
what
they
do  
assuredly 
 but
this
very
thing
implies
intelligence 
for
it
is
a
property
of
the
unselfish
man
to
perceive
that
he
is
acting
unselfishly 
and 
surely 
to
wish
his
fellow
also
to
perceive
it  
true 
but
if
you
misapprehend
my
saying 
you
will
enter
the
ranks
of
those
of
whom
i
spoke
before 
they 
too 
are
led
astray
by
specious
reasonings 
but
if
you
have
the
will
to
understand
what
my
principle
truly
means 
fear
not
that
in
following
it
you
will
neglect
the
duty
of
unselfishness 
  
this
is
a
prayer
of
the
athenians 
 rain 
rain 
dear
zeus 
on
the
plains
and
ploughlands
of
the
athenians  
man
should
either
not
pray
at
all 
or
pray
after
this
frank
and
simple
fashion 
  
just
as
one
says
that
aesculapius
has
prescribed
a
course
of
riding
for
some
one 
or
the
cold
bath 
or
walking
bare footed 
so
it
may
be
said
that
the
guiding
mind
prescribes
for
a
man 
disease 
or
mutilation 
or
losses 
or
the
like 
 prescribed  
in
the
first
case 
means
that
such
treatment
was
enjoined
on
the
patient
as
might
coincide
with
the
needs
of
his
health 
in
the
second
case
it
means
that
each
man s
fortune
is
appointed
to
coincide
with
the
purposes
of
fate 
now 
the
very
word
 coincidence 
implies
something
like
that
correspondence
of
squared
stones
in
a
wall
or
pyramid 
which
workmen
speak
of
when
they
fit
them
together
in
some
structure 
all
things
are
united
in
one
bond
of
harmony 
and
just
as
all
existing
bodies
go
to
make
the
visible
world
what
it
is 
so
destiny 
as
the
general
cause 
is
compounded
of
all
particular
causes 
the
most
unphilosophical
grasp
my
meaning 
for
they
say 
 fate
gave
this
to
so and so 
this
was
appointed
or
prescribed
for
him  
let
us 
then 
receive
the
decrees
of
fate
as
we
receive
the
prescriptions
of
aesculapius 
he
prescribes
many
things
for
us 
and
some
of
them
are
harsh
medicines 
yet
we
obey
him
gladly
in
the
hope
of
health 
conceive
therefore
that 
for
nature 
the
doing
of
her
work
and
the
fulfilling
of
her
purposes
are 
as
it
were 
her
health 
and
welcome
all
that
happens 
even
should
it
seem
hard
fortune 
because
it
tends
to
the
health
of
the
universe 
and
to
the
prosperity
and
felicity
of
zeus 
he
would
not
have
brought
this
or
that
on
any
man
did
it
not
contribute
to
the
good
of
the
whole 
nor
does
any
part
of
nature s
system
bring
aught
to
pass
which
suits
not
with
her
government 
for
two
reasons 
then 
you
should
content
yourself
with
what
befalls
you 
the
first
is 
that
it
was
created
and
ordained
for
you 
and
was
in
a
manner
related
to
you
from
the
beginning 
in
the
weaving
of
all
destinies
from
the
great
first
causes 
the
second
is 
that
even
what
happens
severally
to
each
man
contributes
to
the
well being
and
prosperity
of
the
mind
which
governs
all
things 
and 
indeed 
even
to
its
continued
existence 
for
the
whole
is
maimed
if
you
break
in
the
slightest
degree
this
continuous
connexion 
whether
of
parts
or
causes 
and
this
you
are
doing
your
best
to
break
and
to
destroy
whenever
you
repine
at
fate 
  
fret
not 
neither
despond
nor
be
disheartened 
if
it
be
not
always
possible
for
you
to
act
according
to
your
principles
of
perfection 
if
you
are
beaten
off 
return
again
to
the
effort 
and
content
yourself
that
your
conduct
is
generally
such
as
becomes
a
man 
love
the
good
to
which
you
return 
and
come
back
to
philosophy 
not
as
one
who
comes
to
a
master 
but
as
one
whose
eyes
ache
recurs
to
sponge
and
egg 
as
another
has
recourse
to
plasters 
or
a
third
to
fomentation 
and
thus
you
will
make
no
empty
show
of
obeying
reason 
but
find
that
it
gives
you
rest 
remember
that
philosophy
demands
no
more
than
what
your
nature
requires 
but
you
are
wont
to
desire
other
things
which
accord
not
with
your
nature 
 for
what  
you
say 
 can
be
more
delightful
than
such
things  
is
not
this
the
very
snare
which
pleasure
sets
for
us 
yet
consider
if
magnanimity 
frankness 
simplicity 
kindness 
and
piety
be
not
even
greater
delights 
and
what
is
sweeter
than
wisdom
itself 
when
you
are
conscious
of
security
and
felicity
in
your
powers
of
apprehension
and
reason 
   
the
natures
of
things
are
so
covered
up
from
us 
that
to
many
philosophers 
and
these
no
mean
ones 
all
things
seem
incomprehensible 
the
stoics
themselves
own
that
it
is
difficult
to
comprehend
anything
with
certainty 
all
our
assent
is
inconsistent 
for
where
is
the
consistent
man 
consider 
too 
the
objects
of
our
knowledge 
how
transitory
are
they 
and
how
mean 
how
often
they
are
in
the
possession
of
the
debauchee 
of
the
harlot 
of
the
robber 
review
again
the
morals
of
your
contemporaries 
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
tolerate
the
best mannered
among
them 
not
to
say
that
a
man
can
scarcely
tolerate
himself 
amid
such
darkness
and
filth 
in
this
perpetual
flux
of
substance 
of
time 
of
motion 
and
of
things
moved 
i
can
perceive
nothing
worthy
of
esteem
or
of
desire 
on
the
contrary 
we
should
comfort
ourselves
as
we
await
our
natural
dissolution 
and
not
be
vexed
at
the
delay 
but
find
rest
in
these
thoughts 
first 
that
nothing
can
befall
us
which
is
not
in
accord
with
the
nature
of
all
things 
second 
that
it
is
always
in
our
power
not
to
do
anything
against
the
divine
spirit
within
us 
to
this
no
force
can
compel
us 
   
to
what
end
am
i
using
my
soul 
let
me
examine
myself
as
to
this
on
all
occasions 
and
consider
what
is
passing
now
in
that
part
of
me
which
men
call
the
ruler
of
the
rest 
let
me
think 
too 
whose
is
the
soul
that
i
have 
is
it
a
child s 
is
it
a
youth s 
a
timorous
woman s 
or
a
tyrant s 
the
soul
of
a
tame
beast
or
of
a
savage
one 
   
of
what
value
the
things
are
which
the
many
account
good
you
may
judge
from
this 
if
a
man
has
conceived
certain
things 
such
as
prudence 
temperance 
justice 
or
courage 
to
be
good
in
the
real
sense 
he
cannot 
while
he
is
of
this
mind 
readily
listen
to
the
traditional
gibe
about
a
superabundance
of
good
things 
it
will
not
fit
the
case 
but
when
he
has
in
mind
things
which
seem
good
in
the
eyes
of
the
multitude 
he
is
perfectly
willing
to
hear
and
accept
as
quite
appropriate
the
raillery
of
the
comic
poet 
thus
even
the
ordinary
mind
perceives
the
difference 
for
if
this
were
not
so 
we
would
not
in
the
first
case
repudiate
the
jest
as
offensive 
nor
would
we
salute
it
as
a
happy
witticism
when
applied
to
wealth
or
to
the
opulence
which
produces
luxury
and
ostentation 
proceed
then 
and
put
the
question
whether
these
things
are
to
be
valued
and
esteemed
good
of
which
we
have
such
an
opinion
that
we
may
aptly
say
of
their
possessor 
 he
has
so
many
possessions
about
him
that
he
has
no
place
wherein
to
ease
himself  
   
i
consist
of
a
formal
and
a
material
element 
neither
of
these
two
shall
die
and
fade
into
nothingness 
since
neither
came
into
being
out
of
nothing 
every
part
of
me 
then 
will
be
transformed
and
ranged
again
in
some
part
of
the
universe 
that
part
of
the
universe
will
itself
be
transmuted
into
another
part 
and
so
on
for
all
time
coming 
by
some
such
change
as
this
i
came
into
being 
likewise
my
progenitors 
and
so
back
from
all
time
past 
there
is
no
objection
to
this
theory 
even
though
the
world
be
governed
by
determined
cycles
of
revolution 
   
reason 
and
the
art
of
thinking 
are
powers
which
are
complete
in
themselves 
and
in
their
special
processes 
they
start
from
their
own
internal
principle 
and
proceed
to
their
appointed
end 
such
mental
acts
are
called
right 
to
indicate
that
the
course
of
thought
is
right
or
straight 
   
nothing
should
be
said
to
be
part
of
a
man
which
is
not
part
of
his
human
nature 
things
that
are
not
part
of
his
essence
cannot
be
required
of
him 
and
have
no
part
in
the
promise
or
the
fulfilment
of
his
nature 
therefore 
in
such
things
lies
neither
the
end
of
man
nor
the
good
which
crowns
that
end 
moreover 
if
anything
were
really
part
of
a
man 
it
would
not
be
proper
for
him
to
despise
it
or
revolt
against
it 
nor
would
he
be
praiseworthy
who
made
himself
independent
thereof 
if
non essential
things
were
indeed
good 
he
could
be
no
good
man
who
stinted
himself
in
the
use
of
them 
but 
as
we
see 
the
more
a
man
goes
without
them 
and
the
more
he
endures
the
want
of
them 
the
better
a
man
he
is 
   
the
character
of
your
most
frequent
impressions
will
be
the
character
of
your
mind 
the
soul
takes
colour
from
its
impressions 
therefore
steep
it
in
such
thoughts
as
these   wherever
a
man
can
live 
he
can
live
well 
a
man
can
live
in
a
court 
therefore
he
can
live
well
there 
again
everything
works
towards
that
for
which
it
was
created 
and
that
to
which
anything
works
is
its
end 
and
in
the
end
of
everything
is
to
be
found
the
advantage
and
the
good
of
it 
now 
for
reasoning
beings 
society
is
the
highest
good 
for
it
has
long
since
been
proved
that
we
were
brought
into
the
world
to
be
social 
nay 
was
it
not
manifest
that
the
inferior
kinds
were
formed
for
the
superior 
and
the
superior
for
each
other 
now 
the
animate
is
superior
to
the
inanimate 
and
beings
that
reason
to
those
that
only
live 
   
to
pursue
impossibilities
is
madness 
and
it
is
impossible
that
the
wicked
should
not
act
in
some
such
way
as
this 
   
nothing
can
befall
any
man
which
he
is
not
fitted
by
nature
to
bear 
the
like
events
befall
others 
and
either
through
ignorance
that
the
event
has
happened 
or
from
ostentation
of
magnanimity 
they
stand
firm
and
unhurt
by
them 
strange
then
that
ignorance
or
ostentation
should
have
more
strength
than
wisdom 
   
material
things
cannot
touch
the
soul
at
all 
nor
have
any
access
to
it 
neither
can
they
bend
or
move
it 
the
soul
is
bent
or
moved
by
itself
alone 
and
remodels
all
things
that
present
themselves
from
without
in
accordance
with
whatever
judgment
it
adopts
within 
   
in
one
respect
man
is
nearest
and
dearest
to
me 
in
so
far 
that
is 
as
i
must
do
good
to
him
and
bear
with
him 
but
in
so
far
as
some
men
obstruct
me
in
my
natural
activities 
man
enters
the
class
of
things
indifferent
to
me 
no
less
than
the
sun 
the
wind 
or
the
wild
beast 
by
these
indeed
some
special
action
may
be
impeded 
but
no
interference
with
my
purpose
or
with
my
inward
disposition
can
come
from
them 
thanks
to
my
exceptive
and
modifying
powers 
for
the
mind
can
convert
and
change
everything
that
impedes
its
activity
into
matter
for
its
action 
hindrance
in
its
work
becomes
its
real
help 
and
every
obstruction
makes
for
its
progress 
   
reverence
that
which
is
most
excellent
in
the
universe 
and
the
most
excellent
is
that
which
employs
all
things
and
rules
all 
likewise
reverence
that
which
is
most
excellent
in
yourself 
it
is
of
the
same
nature
as
the
former 
for
it
is
that
which
employs
all
else
that
is
in
you 
and
that
by
which
your
whole
life
is
ordered 
   
that
which
harms
not
the
city
cannot
harm
the
citizen 
apply
this
rule
whenever
you
have
the
idea
that
you
are
hurt 
if
the
state
be
not
hurt
by
this 
neither
am
i
harmed 
and
if
the
state
be
hurt
we
should
not
be
wrathful
with
him
who
hurt
it 
consider
where
lay
his
oversight 
   
consider
frequently
how
swiftly
things
that
exist
or
are
coming
into
existence
are
swept
by
and
carried
away 
their
substance
is
as
a
river
perpetually
flowing 
their
actions
are
in
continual
change 
and
their
causes
subject
to
ten
thousand
alterations 
scarcely
anything
is
stable 
and
the
vast
eternities
of
past
and
future
in
which
all
things
are
swallowed
up
are
close
upon
us
on
both
hands 
is
he
not
then
a
fool
who
is
puffed
up
with
success
in
the
things
of
this
world 
or
is
distracted 
or
worried 
as
if
he
were
in
a
time
of
trouble
likely
to
endure
for
long 
   
keep
in
mind
the
universe
of
being
in
which
your
part
is
exceeding
small 
the
universe
of
time
of
which
a
brief
and
fleeting
moment
is
assigned
to
you 
the
destiny
of
things 
and
how
infinitesimal
your
share
therein 
   
does
another
wrong
me 
let
him
look
to
that 
his
character
and
his
actions
are
his
own 
so
much
is
in
my
present
possession
as
is
dispensed
to
me
by
the
nature
of
things 
and
i
act
as
my
own
nature
now
bids
me 
   
let
the
leading
and
ruling
part
of
your
soul
stand
unmoved
by
the
stirrings
of
the
flesh 
whether
gentle
or
rude 
let
it
not
commingle
with
them 
but
keep
itself
apart 
and
confine
these
passions
to
their
proper
bodily
parts 
and
if
they
rise
into
the
soul
by
any
sympathy
with
the
body
to
which
it
is
united 
then
we
must
not
attempt
to
resist
the
sensation 
seeing
that
it
is
of
our
nature 
but
let
not
the
soul 
for
its
part 
add
thereto
the
conception
that
the
sensation
is
good
or
bad 
   
live
with
the
gods 
and
he
lives
with
the
gods
who
continually
displays
to
them
his
soul 
living
in
satisfaction
with
its
lot 
and
doing
the
will
of
the
inward
spirit 
a
portion
of
his
own
divinity
which
zeus
has
given
to
every
man
for
a
ruler
and
a
guide 
this
is
the
intelligence 
the
reason
that
abides
in
us
all 
   
are
you
angry
with
one
whose
armpits
smell
or
whose
breath
is
foul 
what
is
the
use 
his
mouth
or
his
arm pits
are
so 
and
the
consequence
must
follow 
but 
you
say 
man
is
a
reasonable
being 
and
could
by
attention
discern
in
what
he
offends 
very
well 
you
too
have
reason 
use
your
reason
to
move
his 
instruct 
admonish
him 
if
he
listens 
you
will
cure
him 
and
there
will
be
no
reason
for
anger 
you
are
neither
actor
nor
harlot 
   
as
you
intend
to
live
at
your
going 
so
you
can
live
here 
but 
if
men
do
not
permit
you 
then
depart
from
life 
yet
so
as
if
no
misfortune
had
befallen
you 
if
my
house
be
smoky 
i
go
out 
and
where
is
the
great
matter 
so
long
as
no
such
trouble
drives
me
out 
i
remain
at
my
will 
and
no
one
will
prevent
me
from
acting
as
i
will 
and
my
will
is
the
will
of
a
reasonable
and
social
being 
   
the
intelligence
of
the
universe
is
social 
it
has
therefore
made
the
inferior
orders
for
the
sake
of
the
superior 
and
has
suited
the
superior
beings
for
one
another 
you
see
how
it
hath
subordinated 
and
co ordinated 
and
distributed
to
each
according
to
its
merit 
and
engaged
the
nobler
beings
to
a
mutual
agreement
and
unanimity 
   
how
have
you
behaved
towards
the
gods 
towards
your
parents 
your
brothers 
your
wife 
your
children 
your
teachers 
those
who
reared
you 
your
friends 
your
intimates 
your
slaves 
can
it
be
said
that
you
have
ever
acted
towards
all
of
them
in
the
spirit
of
the
line   
he
wrought
no
harshness 
spoke
no
unkind
word 
recollect
all
you
have
passed
through 
all
that
you
have
had
strength
to
bear 
your
life
is
now
a
tale
that
is
told 
and
your
service
is
all
discharged 
recall
the
fair
sights
you
have
seen 
the
pleasures
and
the
pains
you
have
despised 
the
so called
glory
that
you
have
foregone 
the
unkindly
men
to
whom
you
have
shown
kindness 
   
how
is
it
that
unskilled
and
ignorant
souls
disturb
the
skilful
and
intelligent 
what 
i
ask 
is
the
skilful
and
intelligent
soul 
it
is
that
which
knows
the
beginning
and
the
end 
and
the
reason
which
pervades
all
being 
and
by
determined
cycles
rules
the
universe
for
all
time 
   
in
a
little
space
you
will
be
only
ashes
and
dry
bones
and
a
name 
perhaps
not
even
that 
a
name
is
but
so
much
empty
sound
and
echo 
and
the
things
which
are
so
much
prized
in
life
are
empty 
mean 
and
rotten 
we
are
as
puppies
that
snap
at
one
another 
as
children
that
quarrel 
laugh 
and
presently
weep
again 
but
integrity 
modesty 
justice 
and
truth 
up
from
the
wide wayed
earth
have
soared
to
heaven 
what
then
should
detain
you
here 
things
sensible
are
ever
changing
and
unstable 
the
senses
are
dull
and
easily
deceived 
the
poor
soul
itself
is
a
mere
exhalation
from
blood 
fame
in
such
a
world
is
a
thing
of
naught 
what
then 
you
await
calmly
extinction
or
transformation 
whichever
it
may
be 
and
till
the
fulness
of
the
time
be
come
what
is
to
suffice
you 
what
else
than
a
life
spent
in
fearing
and
praising
the
gods 
and
in
the
practice
of
benevolence 
toleration
and
forbearance
towards
men 
and
whatsoever
lies
beyond
the
bounds
of
flesh
and
breath 
remember
that
it
is
neither
yours
nor
in
your
power 
   
a
prosperous
life
may
be
yours
if
only
you
can
take
the
right
path 
and
keep
to
it
in
all
you
think
or
do 
two
advantages
are
common
to
gods 
to
men 
and
to
every
rational
soul 
in
the
first
place 
nothing
external
to
themselves
has
power
to
hinder
them 
in
the
second 
their
happiness
lies
in
having
mind
and
conduct
disposed
to
justice 
and
in
the
power
to
make
that
the
end
of
all
desire 
   
if
the
fault
be
not
my
sin 
nor
a
consequence
of
it 
if
there
be
no
damage
to
the
common
good 
why
am
i
perturbed
about
it 
wherein
is
the
harm
to
the
common
good 
   
be
not
incautiously
carried
away
by
sentiment 
but
aid
him
that
needs
it
according
to
your
power
and
his
desert 
if
his
need
be
of
the
things
which
are
indifferent 
think
not
that
he
is
harmed
thereby 
for
so
to
think
is
an
evil
habit 
but
as 
in
the
comedy 
the
old
man
begs
to
have
his
fosterchild s
top
for
a
keepsake 
though
he
knows
well
that
it
is
a
top
and
nothing
more 
so
should
you
act
also
in
the
affairs
of
life 
you
mount
the
rostra
and
cry
aloud 
 o
man 
have
you
forgotten
what
is
the
real
value
of
what
you
seek  
 no 
but
the
many
are
keen
in
their
pursuit
of
it  
 are
you
then
to
be
a
fool
because
they
are  
in
whatever
case
i
had
been
left
i
could
have
made
my
fortune 
for
what
is
it
to
make
a
fortune
but
to
confer
good
things
upon
one s
self 
and
true
good
things
are
a
worthy
frame
of
mind 
worthy
impulses 
worthy
actions 
  
the
substance
of
the
universe
is
docile
and
pliable 
the
mind
which
governs
it
has
in
itself
no
source
of
evil doing 
it
has
no
malice 
it
does
no
ill 
and
nothing
is
hurt
by
it 
by
its
guidance
all
things
come
to
be 
and
fulfil
their
being 
  
act
the
part
which
is
worthy
of
you 
regarding
not
whether
you
be
stiff
with
cold
or
comfortably
warm 
whether
you
be
drowsy
or
refreshed
with
sleep 
whether
you
be
in
good
report
or
bad 
whether
you
be
dying
or
upon
some
other
business 
for
death
also
is
one
piece
of
the
business
of
life 
and 
here
as
elsewhere 
it
is
enough
to
do
well
what
comes
to
our
hand 
  
look
within 
let
not
the
proper
quality
or
value
of
anything
escape
you 
  
all
that
exists
will
very
speedily
change 
by
rarefaction 
if
all
substance
be
one 
otherwise
by
dispersion 
  
the
guiding
mind
knows
what
its
own
condition
is 
how 
and
upon
what
matter
its
work
is
done 
  
the
best
revenge
is
not
to
copy
him
that
wronged
you 
  
find
your
sole
delight
and
recreation
in
proceeding
from
one
unselfish
action
to
another 
with
god
ever
in
mind 
  
the
ruling
part
of
you
is
that
which
rouses
and
steers
itself 
making
itself
what
it
wishes
to
be 
and
making
all
that
happens
take
such
appearance
as
it
will 
  
all
things
are
accomplished
according
to
the
will
of
universal
nature 
there
is
no
other
nature
to
influence
them
which
either
comprehends
the
former
from
without 
or
is
contained
within
it 
or
exists
externally 
and
independent
of
it 
   
the
universe
is
either
a
confusion
ravelled
and
unravelled
again 
or
else
a
unity
compact
of
order
and
forethought 
if
it
be
the
former 
why
should
i
wish
to
linger
amid
this
aimless
chaos
and
confusion 
or
have
any
further
care
than
 how
to
become
earth
again  
nay 
why
am
i
disturbed
at
all 
dissolution
will
overtake
me 
do
what
i
please 
but 
if
the
latter
be
the
case 
i
adore
the
ruler
of
all
things 
i
stand
firm 
and
put
my
trust
in
him 
   
whenever
your
situation
forces
trouble
upon
you 
return
quickly
to
yourself 
and
interrupt
the
rhythm
of
life
no
longer
than
you
are
compelled 
your
grasp
of
the
harmony
will
grow
surer
by
continual
recurrence
to
it 
   
had
you
at
one
time
both
a
step mother
and
a
mother 
you
would
respect
the
former 
yet
you
would
be
more
constantly
in
your
mother s
company 
your
court
and
your
philosophy
are
step mother
and
mother
to
you 
return
then
frequently
to
your
true
mother 
and
recreate
yourself
with
her 
her
consolation
can
make
the
court
seem
bearable
to
you 
and
you
to
it 
   
keep
these
thoughts
for
meats
and
eatables 
this
that
is
before
me
is
the
dead
carcase
of
a
fish 
a
fowl 
a
hog 
this
falernian
is
but
a
little
grape
juice 
think
of
your
purple
robes
as
sheep s
wool
stained
in
the
blood
of
a
shell fish 
such
conceptions 
which
touch
reality
so
near 
and
set
forth
the
sum
and
substance
of
these
objects 
are
powerful
indeed
to
display
to
us
their
despicable
value 
in
this
spirit
we
should
act
throughout
life 
and
when
things
of
great
apparent
worth
present
themselves 
we
should
strip
them
naked 
view
their
meanness 
and
cast
aside
the
glowing
description
which
makes
them
seem
so
glorious 
vanity
is
a
great
sophist 
and
most
imposes
on
us
when
we
believe
ourselves
to
be
busy
about
the
noblest
ends 
remember
the
saying
of
crates
about
xenocrates
himself 
   
most
objects
of
vulgar
admiration
may
be
referred
to
certain
general
classes 
there
are 
first 
those
which
hold
together
by
cohesion
or
by
some
organic
unity 
such
as
stone 
timber 
figs 
vines
or
olives 
the
things
which
men 
a
shade
more
reasonable 
admire
are
referred
to
the
class
which
possesses
animal
life
such
as
is
seen
in
flocks
and
herds 
when
man s
taste
is
still
more
cultured
his
admiration
turns
to
things
which
can
show
a
rational
intelligence 
but
he
admires
this
intelligence
not
as
a
universal
principle 
but
only
so
far
as
he
finds
it
expressed
in
art
or
industry 
or 
indeed 
sometimes
merely
so
far
as
it
is
exhibited
by
his
retinue
of
artist
slaves 
but
he
who
values
rational
intelligence
as
a
universal
thing 
and
as
a
social
force 
will
care
nothing
for
these
other
objects
of
admiration 
he
will 
above
all
things 
strive
to
preserve
his
own
mind
in
all
its
rational
and
social
instincts
and
activities 
and
to
this
end
he
will
co operate
with
any
of
his
kind 
   
some
things
hasten
into
being 
some
hasten
to
be
no
more 
even
as
a
thing
is
born
some
part
of
it
is
already
dead 
flux
and
change
are
constantly
renewing
the
world 
just
as
the
unbroken
flow
of
time
ever
presents
to
us
some
new
portion
of
eternity 
in
this
vast
river 
on
whose
bosom
there
is
no
tarrying 
what
is
there
among
the
things
that
sweep
by
us
that
is
worth
the
prizing 
it
is
as
if
a
man
grew
fond
of
one
among
a
passing
flight
of
sparrows 
when
already
it
had
vanished
from
his
sight 
our
life
itself
is
much
like
a
vapour
of
the
blood
or
a
drawing
in
of
air 
our
momentary
actions
of
inhalation
and
exhalation
are
one
in
kind
with
that
whole
power
of
breathing
which 
yesterday
or
the
day
before 
we
received
at
birth 
and
which
we
must
restore
again
to
the
source
from
whence
we
drew
it 
   
it
is
a
small
privilege
to
transpire
like
plants 
or
even
to
breathe
as
cattle
or
wild
beasts
do 
to
feel
the
impressions
of
sense 
to
be
swayed
like
puppets
by
passion 
to
herd
together
and
to
live
by
bread 
all
this
is
no
great
thing 
there
is
nothing
here
superior
to
our
power
of
discharging
our
superfluous
food 
what 
then 
is
of
value 
to
be
received
with
clapping
of
hands 
no 
neither 
therefore 
is
the
applause
of
tongues
more
valuable 
for
the
praises
of
the
multitude
are
naught
but
the
idle
clapping
of
tongues 
dismiss
the
vanity
called
fame 
and
what
remains
to
be
prized 
this 
i
think 
in
all
things
to
act 
or
to
restrain
yourself
from
action 
as
best
suits
the
particular
structure
of
your
nature 
this
is
the
end
of
all
arts
and
studies 
for
every
art
aims
at
making
what
it
produces
well
adapted
to
the
work
for
which
it
was
designed 
the
gardener 
the
vine dresser 
the
horse breaker 
the
dog trainer
all
try
for
this 
and
what
else
is
the
aim
of
all
education
and
teaching 
here 
then 
is
what
you
may
truly
value 
this
well
won 
you
will
seek
for
nothing
more 
will
you 
then 
cease
valuing
the
multitude
of
other
things 
if
you
do
not 
you
will
never
attain
to
freedom 
self sufficiency 
or
tranquillity 
you
cannot
escape
envying 
suspecting 
and
striving
against
those
who
have
the
power
to
deprive
you
of
your
cherished
objects 
nor
plotting
against
men
who
are
in
possession
of
that
on
which
you
set
your
heart 
the
man
who
lacks
any
of
these
things
must 
of
necessity 
be
distracted 
and
be
for
ever
complaining
against
the
gods 
but
reverence
and
respect
for
your
own
intelligence
will
bring
you
to
agreement
with
yourself 
into
concord
with
mankind 
and
into
harmony
with
the
gods 
whom
you
will
praise
for
all
their
good
gifts
and
guidance 
   
upward 
downward 
round
and
round
run
the
courses
of
the
elements 
but
the
course
of
virtue
is
like
none
of
these 
it
follows
a
diviner
path 
well directed
in
a
way
that
is
hard
for
us
to
understand 
   
strange
are
the
ways
of
men 
they
can
speak
no
good
word
of
the
contemporaries
with
whom
they
live 
yet
they
count
it
a
great
thing
to
gain
the
praises
of
a
posterity
whom
they
never
saw
nor
shall
see 
as
well
might
we
grieve
because
we
cannot
hear
the
praises
of
our
ancestors 
   
if
a
thing
seems
to
you
very
difficult
to
accomplish 
conclude
not
that
it
is
beyond
human
power 
but 
if
you
see
that
anything
is
within
man s
power 
and
part
of
his
proper
work 
conclude
that
you
also
may
attain
to
it 
   
in
the
gymnasium 
if
some
one
scratches
us
with
his
nails 
or
in
a
sudden
onset
bruises
our
head 
we
express
no
resentment 
we
are
not
offended 
nor
do
we
suspect
him
for
the
future
as
one
who
is
plotting
against
us 
we
are
on
our
guard
against
him 
it
is
true 
but
not
as
against
an
enemy
or
a
suspected
person 
in
all
good
humour
we
simply
keep
out
of
his
way 
let
us
thus
behave
in
other
affairs
of
life 
and
overlook
the
many
injuries
which
are
done
to
us 
as
it
were 
by
our
antagonists
in
the
gymnasium
of
the
world 
as
i
said 
we
may
keep
out
of
their
way 
but
without
suspicion
or
hatred 
   
if
any
one
can
convince
or
shew
me
that
i
am
wrong
in
thought
or
deed 
i
will
gladly
change 
it
is
truth
that
i
seek 
and
truth
never
yet
hurt
any
man 
what
does
hurt
is
persistence
in
error
or
in
ignorance 
   
i
do
my
duty 
and
for
the
rest
am
not
distracted
by
anything
which
is
inanimate
or
irrational 
or
which
has
lost
or
ignores
the
proper
way 
   
use
the
brute
creation 
and
also
all
material
things 
in
the
spirit
of
magnanimity
and
freedom
which
becomes
him
who
has
reason
in
using
that
which
has
it
not 
towards
men 
who
have
reason 
act
in
a
social
spirit 
in
every
business
call
the
gods
to
aid
thee 
nor

how
long
this
business
shall
endure 
three
hours
spent
therein
may
suffice
you 
   
alexander
of
macedon
and
his
muleteer 
when
they
died 
were
in
a
like
condition 
they
were
either
alike
resumed
into
the
seminal
source
of
all
things 
or
alike
dispersed
among
the
atoms 
   
consider
all
the
many
things 
both
physical
and
spiritual 
that
are
adoing
within
each
of
us
at
the
very
same
instant
of
time 
and
you
will
wonder
the
less
at
the
far
greater
multitudes
of
things 
even
all
that
is 
which
exist
together
in
the
one and all
which
we
call
the
universe 
   
should
some
one
ask
you
how
the
name
antoninus
is
written 
would
you
not
carefully
pronounce
to
him
each
one
of
the
letters 
should
he
then
begin
an
angry
dispute
about
it 
would
you
also
grow
angry 
and
not
rather
mildly
count
over
the
several
letters
to
him 
thus
in
life
remember
that
each
duty
is
made
up
of
a
number
of
elements 
we
should
observe
all
these
calmly 
and 
without
anger
at
those
who
are
angry
with
us 
we
should
set
about
accomplishing
the
task
which
lies
before
us 
   
is
it
not
cruel
to
restrain
men
from
pursuing
what
appears
to
be
their
own
advantage 
and
yet 
in
a
manner 
you
deny
them
this
liberty
when
you
shew
anger
at
their
errors 
men
are
assuredly
attracted
to
what
seems
to
be
their
own
advantage 
 yes  
you
say 
 but
it
is
not
their
advantage  
instruct
them 
then 
and
make
this
evident
to
them 
but
without
anger 
   
death
is
the
cessation
of
the
sensual
impressions 
of
the
impulses
of
the
passions 
of
the
questionings
of
reason 
and
of
the
servitude
to
the
flesh 
   
it
is
shame
and
dishonour
that 
in
any
man s
life 
the
soul
should
faint
from
its
duty
while
the
body
still
holds
out

to
it
that
you
fall
not

caesarism

for
it
may
come

you

your
simplicity 
your

your
sincerity 
your

your

your
kindliness 
your

of
it
in

his

his
serenity

his
sweetness

attempts
to
comprehend

remember
how
he
never
quitted
any
subject
till
he
had
thoroughly
examined
it
and
understood
it 
and
how
he
bore
with
those
who
blamed
him
unjustly 
without
making
any
angry
retort 
how
he
was
never
in
a
hurry 
how
he
discouraged
calumny 
how
closely
he
scanned
the
manners
and
actions
of
men 
how
cautious
he
was
in
reproaching
any
man 
how
free
from
fear 
suspicion 
or
sophistry 
how
little
contented
him
in
the
matter
of
house 
furniture 
dress 
food 
servants 
how
patient
he
was
of
labour 
and
how
slow
to
anger 
so
abstemious
was
his
life
that
he
could
hold
out
until
evening
without
relieving
himself 
except
at
the
usual
hour 
what
a
firm
and
loyal
friend
he
was 
how
patient
of
frank
opposition
to
his
opinions 
how
glad
if
any
one
could
set
him
right 
how
religious
he
was 
and
yet
how
free
from
superstition 
follow
in
his
steps
that
your
last
hour
may
find
you
with
a
conscience
as
easy
as
his 
   
sober
yourself 
recall
your
senses 
shake
sleep
from
you 
and
know
that
it
was
a
dream
that
troubled
you 
and 
now
that
you
are
broad
awake
again 
regard
the
waking

all

because
it
cannot
distinguish
them 
and
to
the
mind
all
things
are
indifferent
also
which
arise
not
from
its
own
activities 
all
these
are
indeed
in
its
own
power 
but
it
is
concerned
with
only
such
of
them
as
are
present 
its
past
and
future
activities
are
indifferent

it
now 
   
no
toil
for
hand
or
foot
is
against
nature 
so
long
as
it
is
proper
for
hand
or
foot
to
do 
no
more 
then 
is
toil
contrary
to
the
nature
of
man 
as
man 
so
long
as
he
is
doing
work
appointed
for
man
to
do 
and
if
it
be
not
contrary

it
cannot
be

for
him 
   
how
many
are
the
pleasures
that
have
been
enjoyed
by
robbers 
rakes 
parricides 
and
tyrants 
   
do
you
not
see
how
common
artificers 
though
they
may
humour
the
public
to
a
certain
extent 
cling
to
the
rules
of
their
art 
and
cannot
endure
to
depart
from
them 
is
it
not
grievous 
then 
that
the
architect
and
the
physician
should
shew
greater
respect
for
the
rules
of
their
several
professions 
than
man
shews
for
his
own
reason 
which
he
possesses
in
common
with
the
gods 
   
asia
and
europe
are
mere
corners
of
the
universe 
the
whole
sea
is
but
a
drop 
athos
a
clod 
all
the
present
is
but
an
instant
in
eternity 
all
things
are
small 
changeable 
and
fleeting 
everything
proceeds
from
the
universal
intelligence 
either
directly
or
as
a
consequence 
thus 
the
jaws
of
lions 
poisons 
all
evil
things
such
as
thorns
or
mire 
are
the
consequences
of
the
grand
and
the
beautiful 
do
not 
then 
imagine
that
they
are
foreign
to
that
which
you
revere 
but
consider
well
the
source
of
all
things 
   
he
who
has
seen
the
present
has
seen
all
that
either
has
been
from
all
eternity 
or
will
be
to
all
eternity 
for
all
things
are
alike
in
kind
and
form 
   
consider
frequently
the
connexion
of
all
things
in
the
universe 
and
their
relation
to
each
other 
all
things
are
in
a
manner
intermingled
with
one
another 
and
are 
therefore 
mutually
friendly 
for
one
thing
comes
in
due
order
after
another 
by
virtue
of
local
movements 
and
of
the
harmony
and
unity
of
the
whole 
   
adapt
yourself
to
the
things
which
your
destiny
has
given
you 
love
those
with
whom
it
is
your
lot
to
live 
and
love
them
with
sincere
affection 
   
a
tool 
an
instrument 
a
utensil 
is
in
good
case
when
it
is
fit
for
its
proper
work 
yet
its
maker
remains
not
by
it 
but
within
the
organisms
of
nature
there
remains
and
resides
the
power
which
made
them 
you
ought 
therefore 
to
reverence
this
power
the
more 
believing
that
if
you
act
in
deference
to
its
will 
all
will
happen
to
you
in
reason 
for
so
in
reason
the
universe
ranges
all 
   
whenever
we
imagine
that
anything
which
lies
not
in
our
power
is
good
or
evil
for
us 
if
the
evil
befall
us
or
if
we
miss
the
good 
we
inevitably
blame
the
gods 
and
hate
the
men
who
are 
or
whom
we
suspect
to
be 
the
cause
of
our
disaster
or
our
loss 
our
solicitude
about
such
things
leads
to
much
injustice 
but
if
we
judge
only
the
things
that
are
in
our
power
to
be
good
or
evil 
there
is
no
reason
left
for
accusing
the
gods
or
for
hating
men 
   
we
are
all
co operating
in
one
great
work 
some
with
knowledge
and
understanding 
others
ignorantly
and
without
design 
it
is
in
this
sense 
i
think 
that
heraclitus
says
that
men
are
working
even
while
they
sleep 
working
together
in
all
that
is
being
done
in
the
universe 
each
works
in
a
different
way 
and
even
those
contribute
abundantly
who
murmur
and
try
to
oppose
and
to
frustrate
the
course
of
nature 
the
world
has
need
even
of
such
as
these 
it
remains
then
for
you
to
make
sure
which
is
the
class
in
which
you
rank
yourself 
the
presiding
mind
will
assuredly
use
you
to
good
purpose
one
way
or
other 
and
will
enlist
you
among
its
labourers
and
fellow workers 
but
see
to
it
that
the
part
that
falls
to
you
lie
not
in
the
vulgar
comic
passage
of
the
play 
of
which
chrysippus
has
spoken 
   
does
the
sun
pretend
to
perform
the
work
of
the
rain 
or
aesculapius
that
of
ceres 
what
of
the
several
stars 
are
they
not
different 
yet
all
jointly
working
for
the
same
end 
   
if
the
gods
took
counsel
about
me
and
what
should
befall
me 
doubtless
then counsel
was
good 
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
gods
wanting
in
forethought 
and
what
could
move
them
to
do
me
wilful
harm 
what
advantage
would
thence
accrue 
either
to
themselves
or
to
the
universe
which
is
their
special
care 
if
they
have
not
taken
counsel
about
me
in
particular 
they
certainly
have
done
so
about
the
common
interest
of
the
universe 
and
i
therefore
should
accept
cheerfully
and
contentedly
the
fate
which
is
the
outcome
of
their
ordinance 
if 
indeed 
they
take
no
counsel
about
anything
 which
it
were
impious
to
believe  
then
let
us
quit
our
sacrifices 
our
prayers 
and
our
oaths 
and
all
acts
of
devotion
which
we
now
perform
as
if
they
lived
and
moved
amongst
us 
but 
granting
that
the
gods
take
no
thought
for
my
affairs 
i
may
still
deliberate
about
myself 
it
is
my
business
to
consider
my
own
interest 
now 
each
man s
interest
is
that
which
agrees
with
the
structure
of
his
nature 
and
my
nature
is
rational
and
social 
as
antoninus 
my
city
and
my
country
is
rome 
as
a
human
being
it
is
the
world 
that
alone 
then 
which
profits
these
two
cities
can
profit
me 
   
all
that
happens
to
the
individual
is
of
profit
to
the
whole 
this
would
suffice 
but
if
you
consider
closely
you
will
see
that
it
is
also
a
general
truth
that
all
that
happens
to
one
man
is
of
profit
to
the
rest
of
mankind 
 profit 
here
should
be
taken
in
a
somewhat
general
sense 
as
referring
to
things
indifferent 
   
in
the
amphitheatre
and
other
such
resorts
the
same
or
similar
spectacles 
continually
presented 
cloy
at
last 
it
is
even
so
in
all
our
experience
of
life 
all
things 
first
and
last 
are
alike 
and
like
derived 
when
shall
the
end
be 
   
think
continually
of
all
the
men
that
are
dead
and
gone 
men
of
every
sort
and
condition 
of
all
manner
of
pursuits 
and
of
every
nation 
return
back
to
philistion 
phoebus 
and
origanion 
pass
down
to
other
generations
of
the
dead 
we
must
all
change
our
habitation
and
go
to
that
place
whither
so
many
great
orators 
so
many
venerable
philosophers 
heraclitus 
pythagoras 
socrates 
and
so
many
heroes
have
gone
before 
and
so
many
generals
and
princes
have
followed 
add
to
these
eudoxus 
hipparchus 
archimedes 
and
other
keen 
great 
laborious 
cunning
and
arrogant
spirits 
yea 
such
as
have
wittily
derided
this
fading
mortal
life
which
is
but
for
a
day 
as
did
menippus
and
his
brethren 
consider
that
all
these
are
long
since
in
their
graves 
and
wherein
here
is
the
harm
for
them 
or
even
for
men
whose
names
are
not
remembered 
the
one
precious
thing
in
life
is
to
spend
it
in
a
steady
course
of
truth
and
justice 
with
kindliness
even
for
the
false
and
the
unjust 
   
when
you
would
cheer
your
heart 
consider
the
several
excellencies
of
those
that
live
around
you 
consider
the
activity
of
one 
the
modesty
of
another 
the
generosity
of
a
third 
and
the
other
virtues
of
the
rest 
nothing
rejoices
the
heart
so
much
as
instances 
the
more
the
better 
of
goodness
manifested
in
the
characters
of
those
around
us 
let
us 
therefore 
have
such
instances
ever
present
for
reflection 
   
are
you
grieved
that
you
weigh
only
these
few
pounds 
and
not
three
hundred 
if
not 
is
there
greater
reason
to
sorrow
if
you
live
only
so
many
years
and
no
longer 
you
are
satisfied
with
your
allotted
quantity
of
matter 
content
yourself
then
likewise
with
the
span
of
time
appointed
you 
   
try
to
persuade
men
to
agree
with
you 
but
whether
they
agree
or
not 
pursue
the
course
you
have
marked
out
when
the
principles
of
justice
point
that
way 
should
one
oppose
you
by
force 
act
with
resignation 
and
shew
not
that
you
are
hurt 
use
the
obstruction
for
the
exercise
of
some
other
virtue 
and
remember
that
your
purpose
involved
the
reservation
that
you
were
not
to
aim
at
impossibilities 
what 
after
all 
was
your
aim 
to
make
some
good
effort
such
as
this 
well 
then 
you
have
succeeded 
even
though
your
first
purpose
be
not
accomplished 
   
the
vain glorious
man
places
his
happiness
in
the
action
of
others 
the
sensualist
finds
it
in
his
own
sensations 
the
wise
man
realizes
it
in
his
own
work 
   
you
have
it
in
your
power
to
form
no
opinion
about
this
or
that 
and
so
to
have
peace
of
mind 
things
material
have
no
power
to
form
our
opinions
for
us 
   
accustom
yourself
to
attend
closely
to
what
is
said
by
others 
and
as
far
as
possible
to
penetrate
into
the
mind
of
the
speaker 
   
what
profits
not
the
swarm
profits
not
the
bee 
   
if
the
sailors
revile
their
pilot 
or
the
sick
their
physician 
whom
will
they
follow
or
obey 
and
how
will
the
one
secure
safety
to
the
crew 
or
the
other
health
to
the
patients 
   
how
many
who
entered
the
world
with
me
are
already
departed 
   
to
the
jaundiced 
honey
seems
bitter 
and
water
is
a
thing
of
dread
to
those
bitten
by
mad
dogs 
to
boys
a
ball
is
a
glorious
thing 
why 
then 
am
i
angry 
has
error
in
the
mind
less
power
than
a
little
bile
in
the
jaundiced 
or
a
little
poison
in
him
who
is
bitten 
   
no
man
can
prevent
you
from
living
according
to
the
plan
of
your
nature 
and
nothing
can
befall
you
which
is
contrary
to
the
plan
of
the
nature
of
the
universe 
   
consider
what
men
are 
whom
they
seek
to
please 
what
they
expect
to
gain 
and
how
they
go
about
to
compass
their
ends 
think
how
soon
eternity
will
shroud
all
things 
and
how
much
is
already
shrouded 
  
what
is
vice 
it
is
what
you
have
often
seen 
in
every
instance
of
it
keep
in
mind
that
you
have
often
seen
the
like
before 
search
up
and
down 
you
will
find
sameness
everywhere 
among
the
events
which
fill
the
history
of
ancient 
middle 
and
present
ages 
among
the
things
of
which
our
cities
and
our
households
are
full
to day 
nothing
is
new 
all
is
familiar
and
fleeting 
  
how
can
the
great
principles
of
life
become
dead
if
the
impressions
which
correspond
to
them
be
not
extinguished 
these
impressions
you
may
still
rekindle 
i
can
always
form
the
proper
opinion
of
this
or
that 
and 
if
so 
why
am
i
disturbed 
what
is
external
to
my
mind
is
of
no
consequence
to
it 
learn
this 
and
you
stand
upright 
you
can
always
renew
your
life 
see
things
again
as
once
you
saw
them 
and
your
life
is
made
new
again 
  
your
vain
concern
for
shows 
for
stage
plays 
for
flocks
and
herds 
your
little
combats 
are
as
bones
cast
for
the
contention
of
puppies 
as
baits
dropped
into
a
fishpond 
as
the
toil
of
ants
and
the
burdens
that
they
bear 
as
the
scampering
of
frightened
mice 
or
the
antics
of
puppets
jerked
by
wires 
it
is
then
your
duty
amid
all
this
to
stand
firm 
kindly
and
not
proud 
yet
to
understand
that
a
man s
worth
is
just
the
worth
of
that
which
he
pursues 
  
in
conversation
we
should
give
good
heed
to
what
is
said 
and
in
every
enterprise
we
should
attend
to
what
is
done 
in
the
latter
case 
at
once
look
to
the
end
in
view 
and 
in
the
former 
note
the
meaning
intended 
  
is
my
understanding
sufficient
for
this
business
or
not 
if
it
be
sufficient 
i
use
it
for
the
work
in
hand
as
an
instrument
given
to
me
by
nature 
if
it
be
not
sufficient 
i
either
give
place
to
one
better
fitted
for
the
achievement 
or 
if
for
some
reason
this
be
not
a
proper
course 
i
do
it
as
best
i
can 
taking
the
aid
of
those
who 
by
directing
my
mind 
can
accomplish
something
fit
and
serviceable
for
the
common
good 
for
all
that
i
do 
whether
by
myself
or
with
the
help
of
others 
should
be
directed
solely
towards
what
is
fit
and
useful
for
the
public
service 
  
how
many
of
those
who
were
once
so
mightily
acclaimed
are
delivered
up
to
oblivion 
and
how
many
of
those
who
acclaimed
them
are
dead
and
gone
this
many
a
day 
  
be
not
ashamed
of
taking
assistance 
it
is
laid
upon
you
to
do
your
part 
as
on
a
soldier
when
the
wall
is
stormed 
what 
then 
if
you
are
lame 
and
cannot
scale
the
battlements
alone 
but
can
with
another s
help 
  
be
not
troubled
about
the
future 
you
will
come
to
it 
if
need
be 
with
the
same
power
to
reason 
as
you
use
upon
your
present
business 
  
all
things
are
twined
together 
in
one
sacred
bond 
scarce
is
there
one
thing
quite
foreign
to
another 
they
are
all
ranged
together 
and
leagued
to
form
the
same
ordered
whole 
the
universe 
compact
of
all
things 
is
one 
through
all
things
runs
one
divinity 
being
is
one 
and
law 
which
is
the
reason
common
to
all
intelligent
creatures 
and
truth
is
one
as
well 
that
is
if
there
be
but
one
sort
of
perfection
possible
to
all
beings
which
are
of
the
same
nature
and
partake
of
the
same
rational
power 
   
everything
material
is
soon
engulfed
in
the
matter
of
the
whole 
and
every
active
cause
is
swiftly
resumed
into
the
universal
reason 
the
memory
of
all
things
is
quickly
buried
in
eternity 
   
in
the
reasoning
being
to
act
according
to
nature
is
to
act
according
to
reason 
   
be
upright
either
by
nature
or
by
correction 
   
in
an
organic
unity
bodily
members
play
the
same
part
as
reasoning
beings
among
separate
existences 
since
both
are
fitted
for
one
joint
operation 
this
thought
will
come
home
to
you
the
more
vividly
if
you
say
often
to
yourself 
 i
am
a
member
of
the
mighty
organism
which
is
made
up
of
reasoning
beings  
if 
instead
of
a
member 
you
say
that
you
are
merely
a
part 
you
have
not
as
yet
attained
to
a
heartfelt
love
of
mankind 
as
yet
you
love
not
well doing
for
its
own
sake
alone 
and
you
still
perform
your
bare
duty 
with
no
thought
that
you
are
your
own
benefactor
by
the
deed 
   
from
the
world
without
let
what
will
affect
whatever
parts
are
subject
to
such
affection 
let
the
part
which
suffers
complain 
if
it
will 
of
the
suffering 
but
i 
if
i
admit
not
that
the
hap
is
evil 
remain
uninjured 
not
to
admit
it
is
surely
in
my
power 
   
let
any
one
say
or
do
what
he
pleases 
i
must
be
a
good
man 
it
is
just
as
gold 
or
emeralds 
or
purple
might
say
continually 
 let
men
do
or
say
what
they
please 
i
must
be
an
emerald 
and
retain
my
lustre  
   
the
soul
which
rules
you
vexes
not
itself 
it
does
not 
for
example 
awake
its
own
fears
or
arouse
its
own
desires 
if
another
can
raise
grief
or
terror
in
it 
let
him
do
so 
by
its
own
impressions
it
will
not
be
led
into
such
emotions 
let
the
body
take
thought 
if
it
can 
for
itself 
lest
it
suffer
anything 
and
complain
when
it
suffers 
the
soul 
by
means
of
which
we
experience
fear
and
sorrow 
and
by
means
of
which 
indeed 
we
receive
any
impression
of
these 
will
admit
no
suffering 
you
cannot
force
it
to
any
such
opinion 
the
ruling
part
is 
in
itself 
free
from
all
dependence 
unless
it
makes
itself
dependent 
similarly 
it
may
be
free
from
all
disturbance
and
obstruction 
if
it
does
not
disturb
and
obstruct
itself 
   
to
have
good
fortune
is
to
have
a
good
spirit 
or
a
good
mind 
what
do
you
here 
imagination 
be
gone 
i
say 
even
as
you
came 
i
have
no
need
for
you 
you
came 
you
say 
after
your
ancient
fashion 
i
am
not
angry
with
you 
only 
be
gone 
   
do
you
dread
change 
what
can
come
without
it 
what
can
be
pleasanter
or
more
proper
to
universal
nature 
can
you
heat
your
bath
unless
wood
undergoes
a
change 
can
you
be
fed
unless
a
change
is
wrought
upon
your
food 
can
any
useful
thing
be
done
without
changes 
do
you
not
see 
then 
that
this
change
also
which
is
working
in
you
is
even
such
as
these 
and
alike
necessary
to
the
nature
of
the
universe 
   
through
the
substance
of
the
universe 
as
through
a
torrent 
all
bodies
are
borne 
they
are
all
of
the
same
nature 
and
fellow workers
with
the
whole 
even
as
our
several
members
are
fellow workers
with
one
another 
how
many
a
chrysippus 
how
many
a
socrates 
how
many
an
epictetus
hath
the
course
of
ages
swallowed
up 
let
this
thought
be
with
you
about
every
man 
and
upon
all
occasions 
   
for
this
alone
i
am
concerned 
that
i
do
nothing
that
suits
not
the
nature
of
man 
nothing
as
man s
nature
would
not
have
it 
nothing
that
it
wishes
not
yet 
   
the
time
is
at
hand
when
you
shall
forget
all
things 
and
when
all
shall
forget
you 
   
it
is
man s
special
business
to
love
even
those
who
err 
and
to
this
love
you
attain 
if
it
is
borne
in
upon
you
that
even
these
sinners
are
your
kin 
and
that
they
offend
through
ignorance
and
against
their
will 
remember
also
that
in
a
little
while
both
you
and
they
must
die 
remember
before
all
things
that
they
have
not
harmed
you 
for
they
have
not
made
your
soul
worse
than
it
was
before 
   
presiding
nature
from
the
universal
substance 
as
from
wax 
now
forms
a
horse 
now
breaks
it
up
again 
making
of
its
matter
a
tree 
afterwards
a
man 
and
again
something
different 
each
of
these
shapes
subsists
but
for
a
little 
yet
there
is
nothing
dreadful
for
the
chest
in
being
taken
to
pieces 
any
more
than
there
formerly
was
in
being
put
together 
   
a
wrathful
look
is
completely
against
nature 
when
the
countenance
is
often
thus
deformed 
its
beauty
dies 
in
the
end
is
quenched
for
ever 
and
cannot
be
revived
again 
seek
to
comprehend
from
this
very
fact
that
it
is
against
reason 
and
if
the
sense
of
moral
evil
be
gone
as
well 
why
should
a
man
wish
to
remain
alive 
   
in
a
little
space
nature 
the
supreme
and
universal
ruler 
will
change
all
things
that
you
behold 
out
of
their
substance
she
will
make
other
things 
and
others
again
out
of
the
substance
of
these 
so
that
the
universe
may
be
ever
new 
   
whenever
someone
offends
you 
consider
straightway
how
he
has
erred
in
his
conceptions
of
good
or
evil 
when
you
see
where
his
error
lies
you
will
pity
him 
and
be
neither
surprised
nor
angry 
indeed
you
yourself
perhaps
still
wrongly
count
good
the
same
things
as
he
does 
or
things
just
like
them 
your
duty
then
is
to
forgive 
and 
if
you
cease
from
these
false
ideas
of
good
and
bad 
you
will
find
it
the
easier
to
grant
indulgence
to
him
who
is
still
mistaken 
   
dwell
not
on
what
you
lack
so
much
as
on
what
you
have
already 
select
the
best
of
what
you
have 
and
consider
how
passionately
you
would
have
longed
for
it
had
it
not
been
yours 
yet
be
watchful 
lest
by
this
joy
in
what
you
have
you
accustom
yourself
to
value
it
too
highly 
so
that 
if
it
should
fail 
you
would
be
distressed

within
yourself

the
understanding
of

they

what
they

reflect
that 
as
heaps
of
sand
are
driven
one
upon
another 
and
the
later
drifts
bury
and
hide
those
that
went
before 
so 
too 
in
life
the
former
ages
are
soon
buried
by
the
next 
   
this
from
plato 
  to
the
man
who
has
true
grandeur
of
mind 
and
who
contemplates
all
time
and
all
being 
can
human
life
appear
a
great
matter 
 impossible  
says
the
other 
 can
then
such
a
one
count
death
a
thing
of
dread  
 no 
indeed   
   
it
is
a
saying
of
antisthenes 
that
it
is
the
part
of
a
king
to
do
good
and
reap
reproach 
   
it
is
a
shameful
thing
that
the
countenance
should
obey
the
mind 
should
compose
and
order
itself
as
the
mind
bids
it 
while
the
mind
cannot
compose
and
order
itself
as
it
wills 
   
vain
is
all
anger
at
external
things
for
they
regard
it
nothing   
   
give
joy
to
us
and
to
the
immortal
gods 
   
for
life
is 
like
the
laden
ear 
cut
down 
and
some
must
fall
and
some
unreaped
remain 
   
me
and
my
children 
if
the
gods
neglect 
it
is
for
some
good
reason 
   
for
i
keep
right
and
justice
on
my
side 
   
weep
not
with
them 
and
still
these
throbs
of
woe 
   
from
plato    i
would
make
him
this
just
answer 
 you
are
mistaken 
my
friend 
to
think
that
a
man
of
any
worth
should
count
the
chances
of
living
and
dying 
should
he
not
rather 
in
all
he
does 
consider
simply
whether
he
is
acting
justly
or
unjustly 
whether
he
is
playing
the
part
of
a
good
man
or
a
bad   
   
he
says
again    in
truth 
athenians 
the
matter
stands
thus 
wheresoever
a
man
has
chosen
his
stand 
judging
it
the
fittest
for
him 
or
wheresoever
he
is
stationed
by
his
commander 
there 
i
think 
he
should
stay
at
all
hazards 
making
no
account
of
death 
or
any
other
evil
but
dishonour  
   
again    consider 
my
friend 
whether
the
truly
noble
and
the
truly
good
be
not
something
quite
apart
from
saving
and
being
saved 
the
man
who
is
a
man
indeed
should
not
set
his
heart
on
living
through
a
few
more
years
of
life 
nor
should
he
make
that
the
end
of
his
desire 
rather
he
should
commit
the
matter
to
the
will
of
god 
assenting
to
the
maxim
which
even
women
use 
that
 no
man
can
elude
his
destiny  
and
studying
in
addition
how
he
may
spend
the
life
that
remains
to
him
for
the
best  
   
contemplate
the
courses
of
the
stars 
as
one
should
do
that
revolves
along
with
them 
consider
also
without
ceasing
the
changes
of
elements 
one
into
another 
speculations
upon
such
things
cleanse
away
the
filth
of
this
earthly
life 
   
it
is
a
good
thought
of
plato s 
that
when
we
discourse
of
men
we
should
 look
down 
as
from
a
high
place  
on
all
things
earthly 
on
herds
and
armies 
on
husbandry
and
marriage 
on
partings 
births 
and
deaths 
on
the
tumults
of
the
courts
of
justice 
on
the
desert
places
of
the
earth 
on
the
varied
spectacle
of
savage
nations 
on
feasting
and
lamentation 
on
traffic 
on
the
medley
of
all
things 
and
the
order
which
emerges
from
their
contrariety 
   
consider
the
past 
and
the
revolutions
of
so
many
empires 
and
thence
you
may
foresee
what
shall
happen
hereafter 
it
will
be
ever
the
same
in
all
things 
nor
can
events
leave
the
rhythm
in
which
they
are
now
moving 
wherefore
it
is
much
the
same
to
view
human
life
for
forty 
as
for
a
myriad
of
years 
what
more
is
there
to
see 
   
to
earth
returns
whatever
sprang
from
earth 
but
what s
of
heavenly
seed
remounts
to
heaven 
this
imports
either
the
loosing
of
a
knot
of
atoms 
or
a
similar
dispersion
of
immutable
elements 
   
by
meats
and
drinks 
and
charms
and
magic
arts
death s
course
they
would
divert 
and
thus
escape 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
gale
that
blows
from
god
we
must
endure 
toiling 
but
not
repining     
   
he
is
a
better
wrestler
than
you 
but
not
more
public spirited 
more
modest 
or
better
prepared
for
the
accidents
of
fate 
not
more
gentle
toward
the
short comings
of
his
neighbours 
   
wherever
we
can
act
conformably
to
the
reason
which
is
common
to
gods
and
men 
there
we
have
nothing
to
dread 
where
we
can
profit
by
prosperous
activity
which
proceeds
in
agreement
with
the
constitution
of
our
nature 
we
need
suspect
no
harm 
   
in
all
places 
and
at
all
times
you
may
devoutly
accept
your
present
fortune 
and
deal
in
justice
with
your
present
company 
you
may
take
pains
to
understand
all
arising
imaginations 
that
none
may
steal
upon
you
before
you
comprehend
them 
   
pry
not
into
the
souls
of
others 
but
rather
look
straight
to
the
goal
whither
nature
is
leading
you 
whither
the
nature
of
the
universe
by
external
events 
and
whither
your
own
nature
by
the
tendency
of
your
own
action 
each
being
must
perform
the
part
for
which
it
was
created 
now
all
other
beings
are
created
for
the
sake
of
those
among
them
which
have
reason 
as
all
lower
things
exist
for
the
sake
of
things
superior
to
them 
and
reasoning
beings
were
created
for
one
another 
the
leading
principle
in
man s
nature 
then 
is
the
social
spirit 
and
the
second
is
victory
over
the
solicitations
of
the
body 
for
it
is
proper
to
the
workings
of
reason
to
set
bounds
to
themselves 
and
never
to
be
overpowered
by
the
calls
of
sense
or
by
the
stirrings
of
passion 
both
of
which
are
animal
in
their
nature 
the
intellect
claims
to
reign
over
these 
and
never
to
be
subjected
to
them 
and
rightly 
because
it
is
equipped
to
command
and
use
all
the
lower
powers 
the
third
element
in
the
constitution
of
a
reasoning
being
is
caution
against
rashness
and
error 
let
the
soul
go
forth
straight
upon
her
way
in
the
possession
of
these
principles 
and
she
stands
seized
of
her
full
estate 
   
consider
yourself
as
dead 
your
life
as
finished
and
past 
live
what
yet
remains
according
to
nature s
laws 
as
an
overplus
granted
to
you
beyond
your
hope 
   
love
that
only
which
is
your
hap 
which
comes
upon
you
as
your
part
in
fate s
great
spinning 
what 
indeed 
can
fit
you
better 
   
upon
every
accident
keep
in
view
those
to
whom
the
like
has
happened 
they
stormed
at
the
event 
wondered
and
complained 
but
now
where
are
they 
they
are
gone
for
ever 
why
should
you
act
the
like
part 
leave
these
unnatural
commotions
to
fickle
men
who
change
and
are
changed 
yourself
take
thought
how
you
may
make
good
use
of
such
events 
good
use
for
them
there
is 
they
will
make
matter
for
good
actions 
let
it
be
your
sole
effort
and
desire
to
gain
your
own
approval
in
every
action 
and
remember
that
the
material
objects
of
both
that
effort
and
of
that
desire
are
things
indifferent 
   
look
inward 
within
is
the
fountain
of
good 
dig
constantly
and
it
will
ever
well
forth 
   
keep
the
body
steady 
without
irregularity 
whether
in
its
motions
or
in
its
postures 
for 
as
the
soul
shews
itself
in
the
countenance
by
a
wise
and
graceful
air 
it
should
require
the
same
expressive
power
of
the
whole
body 
but
all
this
must
be
practised
without
affectation 
   
the
art
of
life
is
more
like
that
of
the
wrestler
than
of
the
dancer 
for
the
wrestler
must
always
be
ready
on
his
guard 
and
stand
firm
against
the
sudden 
unforeseen
efforts
of
his
adversary 
   
consider
constantly
what
manner
of
men
they
are
whose
approbation
you
desire 
and
what
may
be
the
character
of
their
souls 
then
you
will
neither
accuse
such
as
err
unwillingly 
nor
need
their
commendation
when
you
look
into
the
springs
of
their
opinions
and
their
desires 
   
 every
soul  
says
plato 
 parts
unwillingly
with
truth  
you
may
say
the
same
of
justice 
temperance 
good nature 
and
every
virtue 
it
is
most
necessary
to
keep
this
ever
in
mind 
for 
if
you
do 
you
will
be
more
kindly
towards
all
men 
   
in
all
pain
keep
in
mind
that
there
is
no
baseness
in
it 
that
it
cannot
harm
the
soul
which
guides
you 
nor
destroy
that
soul
as
a
reasoning
or
as
a
social
force 
in
most
pain
you
may
find
help
in
the
saying
of
epicurus 
that
 pain
is
neither
unbearable
nor
everlasting 
if
you
bear
in
mind
its
narrow
limits 
and
allow
no
additions
from
your
imagination  
remember
also
that
we
are
fretted 
though
we
see
it
not 
by
many
things
which
are
of
the
same
nature
as
pain 
things
such
as
drowsiness 
excessive
heat 
want
of
appetite 
when
any
of
these
things
annoy
you 
say
to
yourself
that
you
are
giving
in
to
pain 
   
look
to
it
that
you
feel
not
towards
the
most
inhuman
of
mankind 
as
they
feel
towards
their
fellows 
   
whence
do
we
conclude
that
telauges
had
not
a
brighter
genius
than
socrates 
 tis
not
enough
that
socrates
died
more
gloriously
or
argued
more
acutely
with
the
sophists 
or
that
he
kept
watch
more
patiently
through
a
frosty
night 
or
because 
when
ordered
to
arrest
the
innocent
salaminian 
he
judged
it
more
noble
to
disobey 
or
because
of
any
stately
airs
and
graces
he
assumed
in
public 
in
which
we
may
very
justly
refuse
to
believe 
but 
assuming
all
this
true 
when
we
consider
socrates 
we
must
ask
what
manner
of
soul
he
had 
could
he
find
contentment
in
acting
with
justice
towards
men 
and
with
piety
towards
the
gods 
neither
vainly
provoked
by
the
vices
of
others 
nor
servilely
flattering
them
in
their
ignorance 
counting
nothing
strange
that
the
ruler
of
the
universe
appointed 
not
sinking
under
anything
as
intolerable 
and
never
yielding
up
his
soul
in
surrender
to
the
passions
of
the
flesh 
   
nature
has
not
so
blended
the
soul
with
the
body
that
it
cannot
fix
its
own
bounds 
and
execute
its
own
office
by
itself 
it
is
very
possible
to
be
a
god
among
men 
and
yet
be
recognised
by
none 
remember
that
always 
and
this
as
well 
that
the
happiness
of
life
lies
in
very
few
things 
and
though
you
despair
of
becoming
great
in
logic
or
in
science 
you
need
not
despair
of
becoming
a
free
man 
full
of
modesty
and
unselfishness 
and
of
obedience
unto
god 
   
it
is
in
your
power
to
live
superior
to
all
violence 
and
in
the
greatest
calm
of
mind 
were
all
men
to
rail
against
you
as
they
pleased 
and
though
wild
beasts
were
to
tear
asunder
the
wretched
members
of
this
fleshly
mass
which
has
grown
with
your
growth 
what
is
to
hinder
the
soul
amid
all
this
from
preserving
itself
in
all
tranquillity 
in
just
judgments
about
surrounding
things 
and
in
ready
use
of
whatever
is
cast
in
its
way 
judgment
may
say
to
accident   
 your
real
nature
is
this
or
that 
though
you
appear
otherwise
in
the
eyes
of
men  
use
may
say
to
circumstance    i
was
looking
for
you 
to
me
all
that
is
present
is
ever
matter
for
rational
and
social
virtue 
in
sum 
for
that
art
which
is
proper
both
to
man
and
god 
all
that
befalls
is
fit
and
familiar
for
the
purposes
of
god
or
man 
nothing
is
either
new
or
intractable 
but
everything
is
well
known
and
fit
to
work
upon  
   
it
is
the
perfection
of
morals
to
spend
each
day
as
if
it
were
the
last
of
life 
without
excitement 
without
sloth 
and
without
hypocrisy 
   
the
gods 
who
are
immortal 
are
not
vexed
that
in
a
long
eternity
they
must
ever
bear
with
the
wickedness
and
the
multitude
of
sinners 
nay 
they
even
lavish
on
them
all
manner
of
loving
care 
but
you 
who
are
presently
to
cease
from
being 
can 
forsooth 
endure
no
more 
though
you
are
one
of
the
sinners
yourself 
   
it
is
ridiculous
that
you
flee
not
from
the
vice
that
is
in
yourself 
as
you
have
it
in
your
power
to
do 
but
are
still
striving
to
flee
from
the
vice
in
others 
which
you
can
never
do 
   
whatever
the
rational
and
social
faculty
finds
fit
neither
for
rational
nor
for
social
ends 
it
justly
ranks
as
inferior
to
itself 
   
when
you
have
done
a
kind
action 
another
has
benefited 
why
do
you 
like
the
fools 
require
some
third
thing
in
addition  a
reputation
for
benevolence
or
a
return
for
it 
   
no
man
wearies
of
what
brings
him
gain 
and
your
gain
lies
in
acting
according
to
nature 
be
not
weary 
therefore 
of
gaining
by
the
act
which
gives
others
gain 
   
nature
set
about
making
an
ordered
universe 
and
now 
either
all
that
is
follows
a
law
of
necessary
consequence
and
connexion 
or
we
must
admit
that
there
is
least
rationality
in
the
things
which
are
most
excellent 
and
which
appear
to
be
most
special
objects
for
the
impulses
of
the
universal
mind 
remembrance
of
this
will
give
you
calmness
on
many
an
occasion 
  
for
repressing
vain
glory 
it
serves
to
remember
that
it
is
no
longer
in
your
power
to
make
your
whole
life 
even
from
your
youth
onwards 
a
life
worthy
of
a
philosopher 
it
is
known
to
many 
and
you
yourself
know
also 
how
far
you
are
from
wisdom 
confusion
is
upon
you 
and
it
now
can
be
no
easy
matter
for
you
to
gain
the
reputation
of
a
philosopher 
the
conditions
of
your
life
are
against
it 
now
therefore 
as
you
see
how
the
matter
truly
lies 
put
from
you
all
thoughts
of
reputation
among
men 
and
let
it
suffice
you
to
live
so
long
as
your
nature
wills 
though
that
be
but
the
scanty
remnant
of
a
life 
study 
therefore 
the
will
of
your
nature 
and
be
solicitous
about
nothing
else 
you
have
made
many
efforts
and
wandered
much 
but
you
have
nowhere
found
happiness 
not
in
syllogisms 
not
in
riches 
not
in
fame
or
pleasure 
not
in
anything 
where 
then 
is
it 
in
acting
that
part
which
human
nature
requires 
how
can
you
act
that
part 
by
holding
principles
as
the
source
of
your
desires
and
actions 
what
principles 
the
principles
of
good
and
evil 
that
nothing
is
good
for
a
man
which
does
not
make
him
just 
temperate 
courageous 
and
free 
and
that
nothing
can
be
evil
which
tends
not
to
make
him
the
contrary
of
all
these 
  
upon
every
action
ask
yourself 
what
is
the
effect
of
this
for
me 
shall
i
never
repent
of
it 
i
shall
presently
be
dead 
and
all
these
things
gone 
what
more
should
i
desire
if
my
present
action
is
becoming
to
an
intelligent
and
a
social
being 
subject
to
the
same
law
with
gods 
  
alexander 
caesar 
pompey 
what
were
they
compared
with
diogenes 
heraclitus 
socrates 
these
knew
the
nature
of
things 
their
causes
and
their
matter 
and
the
minds
within
them
were
at
one 
as
to
the
former 
how
many
things
they
schemed
for 
and
to
how
many
were
they
enslaved 
  
men
will
go
their
ways
none
the
less 
though
you
burst
in
protest 
  
before
all
things 
be
not
perturbed 
everything
comes
to
pass
as
directed
by
universal
nature 
and
in
a
little
time
you
will
be
departed
and
gone 
like
hadrianus
and
augustus 
then 
scan
closely
the
nature
of
what
has
befallen 
remembering
that
it
is
your
duty
to
be
a
good
man 
do
unflinchingly
whatever
man s
nature
requires 
and
speak
as
seems
most
just 
yet
in
kindliness 
modesty 
and
sincerity 
  
it
is
nature s
work
to
transfer
what
is
now
here
into
another
place 
to
change
things 
to
carry
them
hence 
and
set
them
elsewhere 
all
is
change 
yet
is
there
no
need
to
fear
innovation 
for
all
obey
the
laws
of
custom 
and
in
equal
measure
all
things
are
apportioned 
  
for
every
nature
it
is
sufficient
that
it
goes
on
its
way 
and
prospers 
the
rational
nature
prospers
while
it
assents
to
no
false
or
uncertain
opinion 
while
it
directs
its
impulses
to
unselfish
ends
alone 
while
it
aims
its
desires
and
aversions
only
at
the
things
within
its
power 
and
while
it
welcomes
with
contentment
all
that
universal
nature
ordains 
the
nature
of
each
of
us
is
part
of
universal
nature 
as
the
leaf
is
part
of
the
tree 
the
leaf 
indeed 
is
part
of
an
insensible
and
unreasoning
system
which
can
be
obstructed
in
its
workings 
but
human
nature
is
part
of
that
universal
system
which
cannot
be
impeded 
and
which
is
intelligent
and
just 
hence
is
meted
out 
suitably
to
all 
our
proper
portions
of
time 
of
matter 
of
active
principle 
of
powers 
and
of
events 
yet
look
not
to
find
that
each
several
thing
corresponds
exactly
with
any
other 
consider
rather
the
whole
nature
and
circumstances
of
the
one 
and
compare
them
with
the
whole
of
the
other 
  
you
lack
leisure
for
reading 
but
leisure
to
repress
all
insolence
you
do
not
lack 
you
have
leisure
to
keep
yourself
superior
to
pleasure
and
pain
and
vain
glory 
to
restrain
all
anger
against
the
ungrateful 
nay 
even
to
lavish
loving
care
upon
them 
  
let
no
man
any
more
hear
you
railing
on
the
life
of
the
court 
nay 
revile
it
not
to
your
own
hearing 
   
repentance
is
a
self reproving 
because
we
have
neglected
something
useful 
whatever
is
good
must
be
useful
in
some
sort 
and
worthy
of
the
care
of
a
good
and
honourable
man 
now 
such
a
man
could
never
repent
of
neglecting
some
opportunity
of
pleasure 
pleasure 
then 
is
neither
useful
nor
good 
   
of
each
thing
ask 
what
is
this
in
itself
and
by
its
constitution 
what
is
its
substance
or
matter 
what
is
its
cause 
what
is
its
business
in
the
universe 
how
long
shall
it
endure 
   
when
you
are
reluctant
to
be
roused
from
sleep 
remember
that
it
accords
with
your
constitution
and
with
human
nature
to
perform
social
actions 
sleep
is
common
to
us
with
the
brutes 
now 
whatever
accords
with
the
nature
of
each
species
must
be
most
proper 
most
fitting 
and
most
delightful
to
it 
   
constantly 
and 
if
possible 
on
every
occasion 
apply
to
your
imaginations
the
methods
of
physics 
ethics 
and
dialectic 
   
whomsoever
you
meet 
say
straightway
to
yourself   what
are
this
man s
principles
of
good
and
evil 
for
if
he
holds
this
or
that
doctrine
concerning
pleasure
and
pain 
and
the
causes
thereof 
concerning
glory
and
infamy 
death
and
life 
it
will
seem
to
me
neither
strange
nor
wondrous
that
this
or
that
should
be
his
conduct 
i
shall
bear
in
mind
that
he
has
no
choice
but
to
act
so 
   
remember
that 
as
 tis
folly
to
be
surprised
that
a
fig tree
bears
figs 
so
is
it
equal
folly
to
be
surprised
that
the
universe
produces
those
things
of
which
it
was
ever
fruitful 
it
is
folly
in
a
physician
to
be
surprised
that
a
man
has
fallen
into
a
fever 
or
in
a
pilot
that
the
wind
has
turned
against
him 
   
remember
that
to
change
your
course 
and
to
follow
any
man
who
can
set
you
right
is
no
compromise
of
your
freedom 
the
act
is
your
own 
performed
on
your
own
impulse
and
judgment 
and
according
to
your
own
understanding 
   
if
the
doing
of
this
be
in
your
own
power 
why
do
it
thus 
if
it
be
in
another s 
whom
do
you
accuse 
the
atoms
or
the
gods 
to
accuse
either
is
a
piece
of
madness 
therefore
accuse
no
one 
set
right 
if
you
can 
the
cause
of
error 
if
you
cannot 
correct
the
result
at
least 
if
even
that
be
impossible 
what
purpose
can
your
accusations
serve 
nothing
should
be
done
without
a
purpose 
   
that
which
dies
falls
not
out
of
the
universe 
if
then
it
stays
here 
here
too
it
suffers
a
change 
and
is
resolved
into
those
elements
of
which
the
world 
and
you
too 
consist 
these
also
are
changed 
and
murmur
not 
   
the
horse

things
are
formed
for
some
purpose 
where
is
the
wonder 
even
the
sun
saith 
 i
was
formed
for
a
certain
work  
and
similarly
the
other

for
what
end
are
you
formed 
for
pleasure 
look
if
your
soul
can
endure
this
thought 
   
nature
has
an
aim
in
all
things 
in
the
end
and
surcease
of
them
no
less
than
in
their
beginning
and
continuance 
it
is
even
as
a
man
casting
a
ball 
where 
then 
is
the
good
for
the
ball
in
its
rising 
where
the

even
is
the
harm

down 
where

while
it
holds
together

it

out

or
decayed 
the
praiser

the

the

of
short
continuance

cannot
live
in
concord 
no 
not
even
with
themselves 
and
yet
the
whole

is

point 
   
attend
well
to
what
is

whether
it

soul
can

to
yourself   it
is
now
in
my
power
to
preserve
my
soul
free
from
all
wickedness 
all
lust 
all
confusion
or
disturbance 
and
then 
as
i
truly
discern
the
nature
of
things 
i
can
use
them
all
in
due
proportion 
be
ever
mindful
of
this
power
which
nature
has
given
you 
   
speak 
whether
in
the
senate
or
elsewhere 
with
dignity
rather
than
elegance 
and
let
your
words
ever
be

the

and

familiars
and

and

his

and

has
them
all 
think
next
of
the
death
of
a
whole
house 
such
as
pompey s 
and
of
what
we
meet
sometimes
inscribed
on
tombs 
he
was
the
last
of
his

last
of
all 
consider
the
solicitude
of
the
ancestors
of
such
men
to
leave
a
succession
of
their
own

yet 
at
the
end 
one
must
come
the
last 
and
with
him
dies
all

in
its
single
acts 
so
that
if
each 
as
far
as
may
be 
attains
its
end 
it
will
suffice 
in
this
no
one
can
hinder
you 
but 
you
say 
may
not
something
external
withstand
me   nothing
can
keep
you
from
justice 
temperance 
and
wisdom   yet 
perhaps
some
other
activity
of
mine
may
be
obstructed   true 
but
by
yielding
to
this
impediment 
and
by
turning
with
calmness
to
that
which
is
in
your
power 
you
may
happen
on
another
course
of
action
equally
suited
to
the
ordered
life

which
we
are
speaking

of

without
pride

with

you
have
seen
a
hand 
a
foot 
or
a
head 
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
body 
and
lying
dead
at
a
distance
from
it 
even
such
as
these
does
he
make
himself 
so
far
as
he
can 
who
repines
at
what
befalls 
who
severs
himself
from
his
fellow men 
or
who
does
any
selfish
deed 
are
you
cast
forth
from
the
natural
unity 
nature
made
you
to
be
a
part
of
the
whole 
but
you
have
cut
yourself
off
from
it 
yet
here
there
is
the
glorious
provision
that
you
may
re unite
yourself
if
you
will 
in
no
other
case
has
god
granted
the
privilege
of
re union
to
a
separated
or
severed
part 
yet
behold
the
goodness
and
bounty
with
which
god
hath
honoured
mankind 
he
first
puts
it
in
their
power
not
to
be
severed
from
this
unity 
and
then 
even
when
they
are
thus
severed 
he
suffers
them
to
return
once
more 
to
take
their
places
as
parts
of
the
whole 
and
to
grow
one
with
it
again 
   
universal
nature 
as
she
has
imparted
to
each
rational
being
almost
all
its
faculties
and
powers 
has
given
to
us
this
one
in
particular
among
them 
as
nature
converts
to
her
use 
ranges
in
destined
order 
and
makes
part
of
herself
all
that
withstands
or
opposes
her 
so
each
rational
being
can
make
every
impediment
in
his
way
a
proper
matter
for
himself
to
act
upon 
and
can
use
it
for
his
guiding
purpose 
whatever
it
may
be 
   
do
not
confound
yourself
by
considering
the
whole
of
life 
and
by
dwelling
upon
the
multitude
and
greatness
of
the
pains
and
troubles
to
which
you
may
probably
be
exposed 
as
each
presents
itself
ask
yourself 
is
there
anything
intolerable
and
insufferable
in
this 
you
will
be
ashamed
to
own
it 
and
then
recollect
that
it
is
neither
the
past
nor
the
future
that
can
oppress
you 
but
always
the
present
only 
and
the
ills
of
the
present
will
be
much
diminished
if
you
restrict
it
within
its
own
proper
bounds 
and
take
your
soul
to
task
if
it
cannot
bear
up
even
against
this
one
thing 
   
does
panthea

pergamus
now
sit
mourning
at
the
tomb
of
verus

chabrias

diotimus
at

tomb
of
hadrian 
absurd 
and
if
they
were
still
mourning
could
their
masters
be
sensible
of
it 
or
if
they
were
sensible
of
it 
would
it
give
them
any
pleasure 
or
if
they
were
pleased
with
it 
could
the
mourners
live
for
ever 
was
it
not
fate
that
they
should
grow
old
men
and
women 
and
then
die 
what 
then 
would
become
of
the
illustrious
dead
when
these
faithful
souls
were
gone 
and
all
this
toil
for
a
vile

naught

and
corruption

it
in

in

in
the

take
away
your

about
the

what
is

you

obstruction
of

an

there
are
other
kinds

shall
you
find
anything
that
is
worth
all
this 
   
nothing
can
befall
a
man
which
is
not
human
fortune 
nothing
can
happen
to
an
ox 
to
a

or
to
a
stone
which
is
not
the
natural
destiny
of
their
species 
if 
then 
that
alone
can
befall
anything
which
is
usual
and
natural 
what
cause
is
there
for
indignation 
universal
nature
hath
brought
nothing
upon
you
which
you
cannot
bear 
   
when
you
are
grieved
about
anything
external
it
is
not
the
thing
itself
which
afflicts
you 
but
your
judgment
about
it 
this
judgment
it
is
in
your
power
to
efface 
if
you
are
grieved
about
anything
in
your
own
disposition 
who
can
prevent
you
from
correcting
your
principles
of
life 
if
you
are
grieved
because
you
do
not
set
about
some
work
which
seems
to
you
sound
and
virtuous 
go
about
it
effectually
rather
than
grieve
that
it
is
undone   but
some
superior
force
withstands   then
grieve
not 
for
the
fault
of
the
omission
lies
not
in
you   but
life
is
not
worth
living
with
this
undone   
quit
life
then 
in
the
same
kindly
spirit
as
though
you
had
done
it 
and
with
goodwill
even
to
those
who
withstand
you 
   
remember
that
the
governing
part
becomes
invincible
when 
collected
into
itself 
it
is
satisfied
in
refusing
to
do
what
it
would
not 
even
when
its
resistance
is
unreasonable 
what
then
will
it
be
when 
after
due
deliberation
it
has
fixed
its
judgment
according
to
reason 
the
soul 
thus
free
from
passions 
is
a
strong
fort 
nor
can
a
man
find
any
stronger
to
which
he
can
fly
and
become
henceforth
invincible 
the
man
who
has
not
discerned
this
is
ignorant 
he
who
has
discerned
and
flies
not
thither
is
miserable 
   
pronounce
no
more
to
yourself
than
what
appearances
directly
declare 
it
is
told
you
that
so and so
has
spoken
ill
of
you 
this
alone
is
told
you 
and
not
that
you
are

by
it

my

only
i

i
do
not

that
he
is

dwell
thus
upon
first
appearances 
add
nothing
to
them
from
within 
and
no
harm
befalls
you 
or
rather
add
the
recognition
that
all
is
part
of
the
world s
lot 
   
is
the
gourd
bitter 
put
it
from
you 
are
there
thorns
in
the
way

aside 
that
is
enough 
do
not
add 
 why
were
such
things
brought
into
the
world  
the
naturalist
would
laugh
at
you 
just
as
would
a
carpenter
or
a
shoemaker 
if
you
began
fault finding
because
you
saw
shavings
and
parings
from
their
work
strewn
about
the
workshop 
these
craftsmen
have
places
where
they
can
throw
away
this
rubbish 
but
universal
nature
has
no
such
place
outside
her
sphere 
yet
the
wonder
of
her
art
is
that 
having
confined
herself
within
certain
bounds 
she
transforms
into
herself
all
things
within
her
scope
which
seem
to
be
corrupting 
or
waxing
old
and
useless 
and
out
of
them
she
makes
other
new
forms 
so
that
she
neither
needs
matter
from
without
nor
a
place
where
to
cast
out
her
refuse 
she
is
satisfied
with
her
own
space 
her
own
material 
and
her
own
art 
   
be
not
languid
in
action 
nor
confused
in
conversation 
nor
vague
in
your
opinions 
let
there
be
no
sudden
contractions
or
forth sallyings
of
your
soul 
in
your
life
be
not

you
to
pieces 
pursue
you
with

what
has
this
to

with
your
soul

what
if
some

standing
by

fountain

reproach
it 
it
would
not

to
send
forth
its

speedily
scatter
them

them
away 
and

then
shall
you
get
this
perpetual
living
fount
within
you

yourself

repents
of
almost
everything
he
does 
   
no
longer
be
content
to
breathe
in
harmony
with
the
air
which
surrounds
you 
but
set
about
feeling
in
sympathy
with
the
intelligence
which
embraces
all
things 
for
the
power
of
that
intelligence
is
no
less
diffused 
and
no
less
pervasive
for
all
who
can
draw
it
in 
than
is
the
virtue
of
the
air
for
him
who
can
breathe
it 
   
there
is
no
universal
wickedness
to
hurt
the
world 
and
the
particular
wickedness
of
any
individual
hurts
not
another 
it
hurts
himself
alone 
and
even
he
has
this
gracious
privilege
that 
as
soon
as
he
desires
it 
he
may
be
free
from
it
altogether 
   
to
my
will
the
will
of
another
is
as
indifferent
as
his
poor
breath
and
flesh 
and
how
much
soever
we
were
formed
for
the
sake
of
each
other 
yet
the
governing
part
of
each
of
us
has
its
own
proper
power

the
sun
seems
to
us
diffused
everywhere 
pervasive
of
all
things 
yet
never
exhausted 
this
diffusion
is
a
sort
of
extension 
and
hence
the
greek
word
for
rays
is
thought
to
be
derived 
you
may
observe
the
nature
of
a
ray
if
you
see
it
entering
through
some
small
hole
into
a
darkened
chamber 
its
direction
is
straight 
and
it
is
reflected
around
when
it
falls
upon
any
solid
body 
which
shuts
it
off
from
the
air
beyond 
there
it
stands
and
does
not
slip
or
fall 
now 
such
should
be
the
flow
and
diffusion
of
the
understanding 
never
exhausted 
always
extending 
not
violently
or
furiously
dashing
against
the
obstacles
that
meet
it 
nor
falling
aside 
but
resting
there
and
illuminating
whatever
will
receive
it 
that
which
will
not
transmit
the
light
does
but
deprive
itself
of
radiance 
   
he
who
dreads
death
dreads
either
the
extinction
of
all
sense
or
the
experience
of
a
new
one 
if
all
sense
be
extinguished 
there
can
be
no
sense
of
evil 
if
a
different
sort
of
sense
be
acquired
you
become
a
different
creature

do
not
cease

in

to
pursue

penetrate
into
the

of

and
also
allow

to
enter
into
your

he
who
does
injustice
commits
impiety 
for
since
universal
nature
has
formed
the
rational
animals
for
one
another 
each
to
be
useful
to
the
other
according
to
his
merit 
and
never
hurtful 
he
who
transgresses
this
her
will
is
clearly
guilty
of
impiety
against
the
most
ancient
and
venerable
of
the
gods 
he
who
lies
sins
against
the
same
divinity 
for
the
nature
of
the
whole
is
the
nature
of
all
things
which
exist 
and
things
which
exist
are
akin
to
all
that
has
come
to
be 
nature 
indeed 
is
called
truth 
and
is
the
first
cause
of
all
truths 
he 
then 
that
lies
willingly
is
guilty
of
impiety 
in
so
far
as
by
deceiving
he
works
injury 
and
he
also
who
lies
unwillingly 
in
so
far
as
he
is
out
of
tune
with
universal
nature 
and
in
so
far
as
he
works
disorder
in
the
universe
by
fighting
against
its
design 
he
is
at
war
with
nature
who
sets
himself
against
the
truth 
he
has
neglected
the
means
with
which
nature
furnished
him 
and
cannot
now
distinguish
false
from
true 
he 
too 
who
pursues
pleasure
as
good 
and
shuns
pain
as
evil 
is
guilty
of
impiety 
such
a
one
must
needs
frequently
blame
the
common
nature
for
unseemly
awards
of
fortune
to
bad
and
to
good
men 
for
the
bad
often
enjoy
pleasures
and
possess
the
means
to
attain
them 
and
the
good
often
meet
with
pain
and
with
what
causes
pain 
again 
he
who
dreads
pain
must
sometimes
dread
a
thing
which
will
make
part
of
the
world
order 
and
this
is
impious 
and
he
who
pursues
pleasure
will
not
abstain
from
injustice 
and
this
is
clear
impiety 
in
those
things
to
which
the
common
nature
is
indifferent
 for
she
had
not
made
both 
were
she
not
indifferent
to
either  
he
who
would
follow
nature
ought 
in
this
also 
to
be
of
like
mind
with
her 
and
shew
the
like
indifference 
and
whoever
is
not
indifferent
to
pain
and
pleasure 
life
and
death 
glory
and
ignominy 
all
of
which
universal
nature
uses
indifferently 
is
clearly
impious 
by
nature
using
them
indifferently 
i
mean
that
they
befall
indifferently
all
beings
which
exist 
and
ensue
upon
others
in
the
great
chain
of
consequence
which
began
in
the
primal
impulse
of
providence 
providence 
in
pursuance
of
this
impulse 
and
starting
from
a
definite
beginning 
set
about
this
fair
structure
of
the
universe
when
she
had
conceived
the
plan
of
all
that
was
to
be 
and
appointed
the
distinct
powers
which
were
to
produce
the
several
substances 
changes 
and
successions 
  
it
were
the
more
desirable
lot
to
depart
from
among
men 
unacquainted
with
falsehood 
hypocrisy 
luxury 
or
vanity 
the
next
choice
were
to
expire
when
cloyed
with
these
vices 
have
you
then
chosen
rather
to
abide
in
evil 
or
has
experience
not
yet
persuaded
you
to
fly
from
amidst
the
plague 
for
a
corruption
of
the
mind
is
far
more
a
plague
than
any
pestilential
distemper
or
change
in
the
surrounding
air
we
breathe 
the
one
is
pestilence
to
animals
as
animals 
but
the
other
to
men
as
men 
  
despise
not
death 
but
receive
it
well
content 
as
one
of
the
things
which
nature
wills 
for
even
as
it
is
to
be
young 
to
be
old 
to
grow
up 
to
be
full
grown 
even
as
it
is
to
breed
teeth 
and
beard 
and
to
grow
grey 
to
beget 
to
go
with
child 
to
be
delivered 
and
to
undergo
all
the
effects
of
nature
which
life s
seasons
bring 
such
is
it
also
to
be
dissolved
in
death 
it
becomes
not
therefore
a
man
of
wisdom
to
be
careless 
or
impatient 
or
ostentatiously
contemptuous
about
death 
he
should
rather
await
its
coming
as
one
of
the
operations
of
nature 
even
as
now
you
await
the
season
when
the
child
of
your
wife s
body
shall
issue
into
the
light 
await
the
hour
when
your
soul
shall
fall
out
of
these
its
teguments 
if
you
wish
for
the
common
sort
of
comfort 
here
is
a
thought
which
goes
to
the
heart 
you
will
be
completely
resigned
to
death
if
you
consider
the
things
you
are
about
to
leave 
and
the
morals
of
that
confused
crowd
from
which
your
soul
is
to
be
disengaged 
it
is
far
from
right
to
be
offended
with
them 
it
is
even
your
duty
to
have
a
tender
care
for
them 
and
to
bear
with
them
mildly 
yet
remember
that
the
parting 
when
it
comes 
will
not
be
with
men
who
think
as
you
think 
for
the
only
thing
which 
if
it
might
be 
could
hold
you
back
and
detain
you
in
life 
would
be
to
live
with
those
who
had
reached
the
same
principles
of
life
as
you 
but 
as
it
is 
you 
seeing
how
great
is
the
fatigue
and
toil
arising
from
the
jarring
courses
of
those
who
live
together 
may
cry 
 haste 
death 
lest
i 
too 
should
forget
myself  
  
the
sinner
sins
against
himself 
the
wrong doer
wrongs
himself
by
making
himself
evil 
  
men
are
often
unjust
by
omissions
as
well
as
by
actions 
  
be
satisfied
with
your
present
opinion 
if
certain 
with
your
present
course
of

if

with
your

if
well
pleased
with
all
that
comes
upon

the
soul
distributed
among
the
irrational
animals
is
one 
rational
beings 
on
the
other
hand 
partake
of
one
reasoning
intelligence 
even
so 
there
is
one
earth
to
all
things
earthy 
and 
for
all
of
us
who
are
endowed
with
sight
and
breath 
there
is
one
light
by
which
to
see 
one
air
to
breathe 
  
all
things
that
share
a
common
quality
are
strongly
drawn
to
that
which
is
of
their
own
kind 
the
earthy
tends
towards
the
earth 
fluids
flow
together 
aerial
bodies
likewise 
and
naught
but
force
prevents
their
confluence 
fire
rises
upward
on
account
of
the
elemental
fire 
and
it
is
so
ready
to
join
in
kindling
with
all
the
fire
that
is
here
that
any
matter
pretty
dry
is
easily
set
on
fire 
because
that
which
hinders
its
kindling
is
the
weaker
element
in
its
composition 
thus
also 
then 
whatever
partakes
of
the
common
intellectual
nature
hastens
in
like
manner 
or
even
more
markedly 
towards
that
which
is
akin
to
it 
for
the
more
it
excels
other
natures 
the
stronger
is
its
tendency
to
mix
with
and
adhere
to
its
kind 
accordingly 
among
irrational
creatures
we
find
swarms
of
bees 
herds
of
cattle 
nurture
of
the
young 
and
love 
of
a
sort 
for
even
in
animals
there
is
a
soul 
and
in
the
more
noble
natures
a
mutual
attraction
is
found
to
be
at
work 
such
as
does
not
exist
in
plants 
or
stones 
or
wood 
among
the
rational
animals 
again 
there
are
societies
and
friendships 
families
and
assemblies 
and 
in
war 
treaties
and
truces 
among
beings
still
more
excellent 
there
subsists 
though
they
be
placed
far
asunder 
a
certain
kind
of
union 
as
among
the
stars 
thus
ascent
in
the
scale
can
produce
a
sympathy
even
in
things
that
are
widely
distant 
but
mark
what
happens
among
us 
it
is
only
intellectual
beings
who
forget
the
social
concern
for
one
another 
and
the
mutual
tendency
to
union 
here
alone
the
social
confluence
is
not
seen 
yet
are
they
environed
and
held
by
it 
though
they
strive
to
escape 
and
nature
always
prevails 
observe
and
you
will
see
my
meaning 
for
sooner
may
one
find
some
earthy
thing
which
joins
with
nothing
earthy 
than
a
man
severed
and
separate
from
all
men 
   
man 
god 
and
the
universe 
all
bear
fruit 
and
each
in
their
own
season 
custom
indeed
has
appropriated
the
expression
to
vines
and
the
like 
but
that
is
nothing 
reason
has
its
fruit
both
for
all
men
and
for
itself 
and
produces
just
such
other
things
as
reason
itself
is 
   
if
you
can 
teach
men
better 
if
not 
remember
that
the
virtue
of
charity
was
given
you
to
be
used
in
such
a
case 
nay 
the
gods
are
patient
with
them 
and
even
aid
them
in
their
pursuit
of
some
things
such
as
health 
wealth 
and
glory 
so
gracious
are
they 
you
may
be
so
too 
who
hinders
you 
   
bear
toil
and
pain 
not
as
if
wretched
under
it 
nor
as
courting
pity
or
admiration 
wish
for
one
thing
only 
always
to
act
or
to
refrain
as
social
wisdom
requires 
   
to day
i
have
escaped
from
all
trouble 
or
rather
i
have
cast
out
all
trouble
from
me 
for
it
was
not
without
but
within 
in
my
own
opinions 
   
all
things
are 
in
our
experience 
common 
in
their
continuance
but
for
a
day 
and
in
their
matter
sordid 
all
things
now
are
as
they
were
in
the
times
of
those
we
have
buried 
   
things
stand
without 
by
themselves 
neither
knowing
or
declaring
aught
to
us
concerning
themselves 
what
is
it
then
that
pronounces
upon
them 
the
ruling
part 
   
it
is
not
in
passive
feeling 
but
in
action 
that
the
good
and
evil
of
the
rational
animal
formed
for
society
consists 
similarly
his
virtue
or
his
vice
lies
not
in
feeling
but
in
action 
   
to
the
stone
thrown
up
it
is
no
evil
to
fall 
no
good
to
rise 
   
penetrate
the
souls
of
men 
and
you
will
see
what
judges
you
fear 
and
how
they
sit
in
judgment
on
themselves 
   
all
things
are
in
change 
you
yourself
are
under
continual
transmutation 
and 
in
some
sort 
corruption 
so
is
the
whole
universe 
   
another s
sin
you
must
leave
with
himself 
   
the
ceasing
of
any
action 
the
extinction
of
any
keen
desire 
or
of
any
opinion 
is
as
it
were
a
death
to
them 
this
is
no
evil 
think
again
of
the
ages
of
your
life 
childhood 
youth 
manhood 
old
age 
each
change
of
these
was
a
death 
is
there
anything
to
dread
here 
think
now
of
your
life
as
it
was 
first
under
your
grandfather 
then
under
your
mother 
then
under
your
father 
and 
as
you
find
there
many
other
alterations 
changes 
and
endings 
ask
yourself 
is
there
anything
to
dread
here 
thus
neither
is
there
anything
to
dread
in
the
cessation 
ending 
and
change
of
your
whole
life 
   
make
swift
appeal
to
your
own
ruling
part 
to
that
of
the
universe 
and
to
his
who
has
offended
you 
to
your
own 
that
you
may
make
it
a
mind
disposed
to
justice 
to
that
of
the
universe 
that
you
may
remember
of
what
you
are
a
part 
and
to
his 
that
you
may
know
whether
he
has
acted
in
ignorance
or
by
design 
and
that
you
may
also
reflect
that
he
is
your
kinsman 
   
you
yourself
are
a
part
of
a
social
system
necessary
to
complete
the
whole 
accordingly 
let
your
every
action
be
a
similar
part
of
the
social
life 
and
if
any
action
has
not
its
reference 
either
immediate
or
distant 
to
the
common
good
as
its
end 
this
action
disorders
your
life
and
frustrates
its
unity 
it
is
sedition
like
that
of
the
man
who 
in
a
commonwealth 
does
all
in
his
power
to
sever
himself
from
the
general
harmony
and
concord 
   
children s
quarrels 
child s
play 
poor
spirits
carrying
about
dead
corpses 
such
is
our
life 
the
 masque
of
the
dead 
is
intelligible
by
comparison 
   
go
to
the
quality
of
the
cause 
abstract
it
from
the
material 
and
contemplate
it
by
itself 
determine
then
the
time 
how
long 
at
furthest 
this
thing 
of
this
peculiar
quality 
can
naturally
subsist 
   
you
have
endured
innumerable
sufferings
by
not
being
satisfied
with
your
own
ruling
part
when
it
does
the
things
which
it
was
formed
to
do 
enough
then
of
that 
   
when
another
reproaches
or
hates
you 
or
utters
anything
to
that
purpose 
go
to
his
soul 
enter
in
there 
and
look
what
manner
of
man
he
is 
you
will
see
that
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
to
make
him
think
well
or
ill
of
you 
yet
you
should
be
kindly
towards
such
men 
for
they
are
by
nature
your
friends 
and
the
gods 
too 
aid
them
in
all
ways 
by
dreams 
by
oracles 
and
even
in
the
things
about
which
they
are
most
eager 
   
the
course
of
things
in
the
world
is
ever
the
same 
a
continual
rotation 
up
and
down 
from
age
to
age 
either
the
universal
mind
exerts
itself
in
every
particular
event 
in
which
case
you
must
accept
what
comes
immediately
from
it 
or
it
has
exerted
itself
once
and
for
all 
and 
as
a
result 
all
things
go
on
for
ever 
in
a
necessary
chain
of
consequence 
or
again
atoms
and
indivisible
particles
are
the
origin
of
all
things 
in
fine 
if
there
be
a
god 
all
is
well 
and
if
there
be
only
chance 
you
at
least
need
not
act
by
chance 
the
earth
will
presently
cover
us
all 
and
then
this
earth
will
itself
be
changed
into
other
forms 
and
these
again
into
others 
and
so
on
without
end 
and 
if
any
one
considers
how
swiftly
those
changes
and
transmutations
roll
on 
like
one
wave
upon
another 
he
will
despise
all
things
mortal 
   
the
universal
cause
is
like
a
winter
torrent 
it
sweeps
all
along
with
it 
how
very
little
worth
are
those
poor
creatures
who
pretend
to
understand
affairs
of
state 
and
imagine
they
unite
in
themselves
the
statesman
and
the
philosopher 
the
frothy
fools 
do
you 
o
man 
that
which
nature
now
requires
of
you 
set
about
it
if
you
have
the
means 
and
look
not
around
you
to
see
if
any
be
taking
notice 
neither
hope
to
realize
plato s
republic 
be
satisfied
if
the
smallest
thing
go
well 
consider
even
such
an
event
as
no
small
matter 
for
who
can
change
the
opinions
of
men 
and
without
change
of
opinion
what
is
their
state
but
a
slavery 
under
which
they
groan 
while
they
pretend
to
obey 
come
now 
speak
of
alexander 
philip 
and
demetrius
of
phalerum 
they
know
best
whether
they
understood
what
the
common
nature
required
of
them 
and
whether
they
trained
themselves
accordingly 
but 
if
they
designed
only
to
play
the
tragic
hero 
no
one
has
condemned
me
to
do
the
like 
the
work
of
philosophy
is
simple
and
modest 
lead
me
not
astray
in
pursuit
of
a
vainglorious
stateliness 
   
look
down 
as
from
some
eminence 
upon
the
innumerable
herds 
the
countless
solemn
festivals 
the
voyaging
of
every
sort 
in
tempests
and
in
calms 
the
different
states
of
those
who
come
into
life 
enter
upon
life s
associations 
and
leave
it
in
the
end 
consider 
too 
the
life
which
others
have
lived
formerly 
the
life
they
will
live
after
you 
and
the
life
that
barbarous
peoples
are
now
living 
how
many
of
these
know
not
even
your
name 
how
many
will
quickly
forget
it 
how
many
are
there
who
perhaps
praise
you
now 
but
will
shortly
blame
you 
reflect 
then 
that
neither
is
surviving
fame
a
thing
of
value 
nor
present
glory 
nor
anything
at
all 
   
let
nothing
due
to
a
cause
outside
yourself
disturb
your
calm 
in
the
workings
of
the
active
principle
within
you
let
there
be
justice 
that
is
a
bent
of
will
and
a
course
of
action
which
have
social
good
as
their
one
end 
and
so
are
suited
to
your
nature 
   
you
can
suppress
many
of
the
superfluous
troubles
which
beset
you 
for
they
lie
wholly
in
your
own
opinion 
by
this
you
will
give
ample
room
and
ease
to
your
life 
you
may
compass
this
end
by
comprehending
the
whole
universe
in
your
judgment 
by
contemplating
eternity 
and
by
reflecting
on
the
swift
changes
of
individual
things 
thinking
how
short
is
the
time
from
their
birth
to
their
dissolution 
how
immense
the
space
of
ages
before
that
birth 
how
equally
infinite
the
eternity
which
shall
succeed
that
dissolution 
   
all
things
that
you
see
will
quickly
perish 
and
those
who
behold
them
perishing
are
very
soon
themselves
to
die 
and
he
who
dies
oldest
will
be
in
like
case
with
him
who
dies
before
his
time 
   
what
manner
of
souls
have
these
men 
what
is
the
end
of
their
striving 
and
on
what
accounts
do
they
love
and
honour 
imagine
their
souls
naked
before
you 
when
they
fancy
that
their
censures
hurt 
or
their
praises
profit
us 
how
great
is
their
self conceit 
   
loss
is
naught
but
change 
in
change
is
the
joy
of
universal
nature 
and
by
her
all
things
are
ordered
well 
from
the
beginning
of
ages
they
have
been
shaped
alike 
and
to
all
eternity
they
will
be
the
same 
how
then
can
you
say
that
all
things
have
been 
and
ever
will
be
evil 
that
among
so
many
gods
there
has
been
found
no
power
to
rectify 
but
that
the
universe
is
condemned
to
endure
the
burden
of
never ending
ill 
   
how
corrupt
is
the
material
substance
of
every
thing 
water 
dust 
bones 
and
foulness 
again 
marble
is
but
the
concrete
humour
of
the
earth 
gold
and
silver
its
heavy
dregs 
our
garments
are
but
hair 
the
purple
dye
blood 
all
else
is
of
a
like
nature 
breath 
too 
is
just
the
same 
ever
changing
from
this
to
that 
   
enough
of
this
wretched
life 
enough
of
repining
and
apish
trifling 
why
are
you
disturbed 
are
any
of
these
troubles
new 
what
excites
you
so 
is
it
the
cause 
then
view
it
well 
is
it
the
matter 
view
it
also
well 
besides
these
there
is
nothing 
wherefore
at
last
act
with
more
simplicity
and
goodness
towards
the
gods 
whether
you
look
on
this
spectacle
for
a
hundred
years
or
for
three
it
is
the
same 
   
if
he
has
done
wrong 
the
evil
is
with
him 
and
perhaps 
too 
he
has
not
done
wrong 
   
either
all
things
proceed
from
one
source
of
intelligence
and
come
together
in
one
body 
in
which
case
the
part
must
not
complain
of
what
comes
about
for
the
benefit
of
the
whole 
or
all
is
atoms 
and
there
is
nothing
else
but
confused
mixture
and
dissipation 
why
then
are
you
disturbed 
say
to
your
soul 
 thou
art
dead 
thou
art
rotten 
thou
hast
turned
beast 
joined
the
herd 
and
dost
feed
along
with
them  
   
either
the
gods
have
power
or
they
have
none 
if
they
have
no
power 
why
do
you
pray 
if
they
have
power 
why
do
you
not
choose
to
pray
to
them
for
power
neither
to
fear 
nor
to
desire 
nor
to
be
grieved
over
any
of
these
external
things 
rather
than
for
their
presence
or
their
absence 
surely 
if
the
gods
can
aid
man
at
all 
they
can
aid
him
in
this 
but
perhaps
you
will
say
 the
gods
have
put
this
in
my
own
power  
then
is
it
not
better
to
use
that
which
is
in
your
own
power
and
preserve
your
liberty 
than
to
set
your
heart
on
what
is
beyond
your
power
and
become
an
abject
slave 
and
who
has
told
you
that
the
gods
aid
us
not
in
these
things
also
which
are
in
our
power 
begin
to
pray
about
them
and
you
will
see 
one
man
prays 
 may
i
possess
that
woman  
do
you
pray 
 may
i
have
no
wish
to
possess
her  
another
prays 
 may
i
be
delivered
from
so
and
so  
pray
you 
 may
i
not
need
to
be
delivered
from
him  
a
third
cries 
 may
i
not
lose
my
child  
let
your
prayer
be 
 may
i
not
fear
to
lose
him  
in
fine 
turn
your
prayers
this
way 
and
observe
what
comes
of
it 
   
epicurus
says 
 in
my
sickness
my
conversations
were
not
about
the
diseases
of
this
poor
body 
nor
did
i
speak
of
any
such
things
to
those
who
came
to
me 
i
continued
to
discourse
as
before
on
the
principles
of
natural
philosophy 
and
was
chiefly
intent
on
the
problem
of
how
the
mind 
though
it
partakes
in
the
violent
commotions
of
the
flesh 
might
remain
undisturbed
and
keep
guard
on
its
own
proper
excellence 
i
permitted
not
the
physicians  
he
continues 
 to
magnify
their
office 
and
vaunt
themselves
as
if
they
were
doing something
of
great
moment 
but
my
life
continued
pleasant
and
happy  
what
he
did
then 
in
sickness 
do
you
also
if
ye
fall
ill 
or
suffer
any
other
misfortune 
never
to
depart
from
your
philosophy
whatever
befalls
you 
never
to
join
in
the
folly
of
the
vulgar
and
the
ignorant 
is
a
maxim
common
to
all
the
schools 
give
your
mind
only
to
the
business
now
in
hand
and
to
the
means
whereby
it
is
to
be
accomplished 
   
when
you
are
offended
by
the
shamelessness
of
any
man 
straightway
ask
yourself 
can
the
world
exist
without
shameless
men 
it
cannot 
therefore
do
not
demand
what
is
impossible 
your
enemy
also
is
one
of
these
shameless
people
who
must
needs
be
in
the
universe 
have
the
same
question
also
at
hand
when
you
are
shocked
at
craft 
or
perfidy 
or
any
other
sin 
for
while
you
remember
that
it
is
impossible
that
the
class
should
not
exist 
you
will
be
more
charitable
to
each
particular
individual 
it
is
useful
also
to
have
this
reflection
ready 
what
virtue
has
nature
given
to
man
wherewith
to
combat
this
fault 
against
unreason
she
has
given
meekness
as
an
antidote 
against
another
weakness
another
power 
you
are
also
at
full
liberty
to
set
right
one
who
has
wandered 
now
every
wrong doer
is
missing
his
proper
aim
and
has
gone
astray 
and
then 
in
what
are
you
injured 
you
will
find
that
none
of
those
at
whom
you
are
exasperated
have
done
anything
whereby
your
intellectual
part
was
like
to
be
the
worse 
now
anything
which
can
really
harm
or
hurt
you
has
its
subsistence
there 
and
there
alone 
and
wherein
is
it
strange
or
evil
that
the
man
untaught
acts
after
his
kind 
look
if
you
ought
not
rather
to
blame
yourself
for
not
having
laid
your
account
with
his
being
guilty
of
such
faults 
your
reason
gave
you
the
means
to
conclude
that
it
was
probable
that
he
would
do
this
wrong 
you
forgot 
and
yet
wonder
that
he
has
done
it 
but
above
all 
when
you
are
blaming
any
one
for
faithlessness
or
ingratitude 
turn
to
yourself 
the
fault
lies
manifestly
with
you 
if
you
trusted
that
a
man
of
such
a
disposition
could
keep
faith 
or
if 
when
you
granted
the
favour 
you
did
not
grant
it
without
ulterior
views 
and
on
the
principle
that
the
complete
and
immediate
reward
of
your
action
lay
in
the
doing
of
it 
what
would
you
more 
when
you
have
done
a
man
a
kindness 
is
it
not
enough
for
you
that
you
have
acted
in
this
according
to
your
nature 
do
you
ask
a
reward
for
it 
it
is
as
if
the
eye
were
to
ask
a
reward
for
seeing 
or
the
feet
for
walking 
for
just
as
these
parts
are
formed
for
a
certain
purpose 
which
when
they
fulfil
according
to
their
proper
structure 
they
attain
their
proper
end 
so
man 
formed
by
nature
to
do
kindness
to
his
fellows 
whenever
he
acts
kindly 
or
in
any
other
way
works
for
the
common
good 
has
fulfilled
the
purpose
of
his
creation 
and
has
possession
of
what
is
his
own 
  
wilt
thou
ever 
o
my
soul 
be
good
and
single 
and
one 
and
naked 
more
open
to
view
than
the
body
which
surrounds
thee 
wilt
thou
ever
taste
of
the
loving
and
satisfied
temper 
wilt
thou
ever
be
full
and
without
wants 
setting
thy
heart
on
nothing 
animate
or
inanimate 
for
the
enjoyment
of
pleasure 
not
desiring
time
for
longer
enjoyment 
nor
place 
nor
country 
nor
fine
climate 
nor
congenial
company 
wilt
thou
be
satisfied
with
thy
present
state 
and
well
pleased
with
every
present
circumstance 
wilt
thou
persuade
thyself
that
all
things
are
thine 
that
all
is
well
with
thee 
that
all
comes
to
thee
from
the
gods 
and
that
what
is
best
for
thee
is
what
they
are
pleased
to
give 
now
and
henceforth 
for
the
preservation
of
that
perfected
being 
which
is
good 
just 
and
beautiful 
which
generates 
combines 
embraces 
and
includes
all
fleeting
things
that
dissolve
to
bring
forth
others
like
themselves 
wilt
thou
never
be
able
to
live
a
fellow
citizen
with
gods
and
men 
approving
them
and
by
them
approved 
  
in
so
far
as
you
are
governed
by
nature
only 
observe
carefully
what
nature
demands 
then
do
that
freely 
if
thereby
your
nature
as
a
living
being
be
not
made
worse 
next
you
must
consider
what
the
nature
of
a
living
being
demands 
and
allow
yourself
everything
of
this
kind
by
which
your
nature
as
a
rational
being
is
not
made
worse 
now
it
is
plain
that
what
is
rational
is
also
social 
therefore
follow
these
rules
and
trouble
no
further 
  
whatever
happens 
nature
has
either
formed
you
able
to
bear
it
or
unable 
if
able 
then
bear
it
as
nature
has
made
you
able 
and
fret
not 
if
unable 
yet
do
not
fret 
for
when
the
trial
has
consumed
you
it
too
will
pass
away 
remember 
however 
that
nature
has
made
you
able
to
bear
whatever
it
is
in
the
power
of
your
own
opinion
to
make
endurable
or
tolerable 
if
only
you
conceive
it
profitable
or
fit
to
be
borne 
  
if
a
man
is
going
wrong 
instruct
him
kindly 
and
shew
him
his
mistake 
if
you
are
unable
to
do
this 
blame
yourself
or
none 
  
whatever
happens
to
you
was
prearranged
for
you
from
all
eternity 
and
the
concatenation
of
causes
had
from
eternity
interwoven
your
existence
with
this
contingency 
  
whether
all
be
atoms 
or
there
be
a
universal
law
of
nature 
let
it
be
laid
down
first
that
i
am
a
part
of
the
whole
which
is
governed
by
nature 
secondly 
that
i
am
associated
with
other
parts
like
myself 
mindful
of
this 
since
i
am
a
part 
i
shall
not
be
dissatisfied
with
anything
appointed
me
by
the
whole 
for
nothing
is
hurtful
to
the
part
which
is
profitable
to
the
whole 
since
the
whole
contains
nothing
unprofitable
to
itself 
all
natural
systems
have
this
law
in
common 
and
the
system
of
the
universe
has
another
law
besides 
namely
that
it
cannot
be
forced
by
any
external
cause
to
produce
anything
hurtful
to
itself 
if
therefore
i
remember
that
i
am
part
of
such
a
whole 
i
shall
be
satisfied
with
all
that
flows
therefrom 
and 
inasmuch
as
i
am
associated
with
parts
like
myself 
i
will
do
nothing
unsocial 
but
rather
draw
to
my
kind 
turn
my
every
endeavour
to
the
public
good 
and
shun
the
contrary 
in
such
a
course
my
life
must
needs
run
well 
just
as
you
would
hold
that
the
life
of
a
citizen
runs
well
when
he
passes
on
from
one
public spirited
action
to
another 
and
throws
himself
heartily
into
every
task
appointed
him
by
the
state 
  
the
parts
of
the
whole 
i
mean
the
parts
which
are
contained
in
the
universe 
must
necessarily
perish 
 perish  
let
us
say 
meaning
change 
now 
if
it
be
a
necessary
evil
for
the
parts
to
perish 
it
could
not
be
well
for
the
whole
that
its
parts
should
tend
to
change
and
be
constructed
to
perish
in
various
ways 
did
nature
then
set
out
to
injure
her
own
constituent
parts 
making
them
so
that
they
are
liable
to
evil
and
of
necessity
fall
into
it 
or
did
it
escape
her
notice
that
this
comes
to
pass 
both
suppositions
are
incredible 
and
if 
dropping
the
notion
of
nature 
one
were
merely
to
put
it
that
things
are
constituted
so 
then
how
ridiculous
at
the
same
time
to
say
that
the
parts
of
the
universe
are
constituted
so
as
to
change 
and
also
to
wonder
and
fret
at
change
or
dissolution 
as
if
it
were
something
against
the
course
of
nature 
especially
as
everything
is
dissolved
into
the
elements
out
of
which
it
arose 
for
there
is
either
a
scattering
of
the
elements
of
which
a
thing
was
constructed 
or
a
conversion
of
these 
of
the
solid
into
earth 
of
the
spiritual
into
air 
so
that
these
constituents
are
resumed
into
the
system
of
the
universe 
which
either
undergoes
periodical
conflagration 
or
is
renewed
by
never ending
changes 
and
do
not
imagine
that
you
had
all
your
earthy
and
aerial
matter
from
your
birth 
for
the
whole
of
this
was
an
accession
of
yesterday
or
the
day
before 
from
your
food
and
from
the
air
you
breathed 
it
is
this
accession
which
changes 
and
not
what
your
mother
bore 
and
granting
that
this
recent
accession
may
incline
you
more
to
what
is
individual
in
your
constitution 
yet 
i
think 
it
alters
nothing
of
what
has
just
been
said 
  
having
taken
to
yourself
these
titles 
good 
modest 
true 
prudent 
even tempered
and
magnanimous 
look
to
it
that
you
change
them
not 
and 
if
you
should
come
to
lose
them 
seek
them
straightway
again 
and
remember
that
prudence
means
for
you
reasoned
observation
of
all
things 
and
careful
attention 
even
temper 
cheerful
acceptance
of
the
lot
appointed
by
universal
nature 
magnanimity 
the
exaltation
of
the
thinking
part
above
any
pleasant
or
painful
commotions
of
the
flesh 
above
vain glory 
above
death
and
all
such
things 
if
you
steadfastly
maintain
yourself
in
these
titles 
with
no
hankering
after
hearing
them
given
to
you
by
others 
you
will
be
a
new
man 
and
a
new
life
will
open
for
you 
for
to
continue
as
you
have
been
till
now 
in
the
same
life
of
distraction
and
defilement 
would
mark
you
as
a
man
devoid
of
sense 
who
clings
to
life
like
the
half eaten
beast fighters 
who 
though
covered
with
wounds
and
gore 
do
yet
appeal
to
be
reserved
until
tomorrow 
to
be
cast
again
in
their
wretchedness
to
the
claws
and
fangs
that
lacerated
them
before 
take
your
stand
then
on
these
few
titles 
and
if
you
are
able
to
abide
in
them 
abide 
as
one
removed
to
the
islands
of
the
blest 
but
if
you
perceive
that
you
are
falling
away 
and
cannot
prevail 
have
the
courage
to
retire
into
some
corner
where
you
may
hope
to
prevail 
or
else
depart
from
life
altogether 
not
in
anger
but
in
all
simplicity 
freedom 
and
modesty 
having
done
at
least
one
thing
in
life
well 
by
so
leaving
it 
now
it
will
greatly
help
you
to
be
mindful
of
your
titles 
if
you
recollect
that
the
gods
desire
not
adulation 
but
that
reasoning
beings
should
grow
in
likeness
to
themselves 
and
further
that
a
fig
tree
is
set
to
bear
figs 
a
dog
to
hunt 
a
bee
to
gather
honey 
and
a
man
to
do
a
man s
work 
  
mimes 
war 
panic 
sloth 
servility 
will
wipe
out
the
sacred
maxims
which
you
have
gathered
by
observing
nature
and
stored
in
your
mind 
you
ought
to
look
and
act
in
every
case
so
that
not
only
shall
the
task
before
you
be
accomplished 
but
also
your
theoretic
faculty
exercised 
and
the
self confidence
which
springs
from
special
knowledge
preserved
without
ostentation
or
affected
concealment 
will
you
ever
attain
to
simplicity 
to
dignity 
to
a
perfect
discrimination
in
every
case
as
to
what
a
thing
really
is 
what
its
true
place
in
the
universe 
what
the
time
it
may
endure 
what
its
composition 
to
whom
it
may
belong 
and
who
can
give
and
take
it
away 
   
the
spider
exults
when
he
has
captured
a
fly 
one
man
because
he
has
taken
a
little
hare 
another
because
he
has
netted
an
anchovy 
another
because
he
has
hunted
down
a
wild
boar
or
a
bear 
and
another
because
he
has
conquered
the
sarmatians 
but
are
they
not
brigands
all 
if
you
look
to
their
principles 
   
acquire
a
method
of
perceiving
how
all
things
change
into
one
another 
pursue
this
branch
of
philosophy
and
continually
exercise
yourself
therein 
there
is
nothing
so
proper
as
this
for
cultivating
greatness
of
mind 
he
who
does
so
has
already
put
off
the
body 
and 
having
realized
how
soon
he
must
depart
from
among
men
and
leave
all
earthly
things
behind
him 
he
resigns
himself
entirely
to
justice
in
all
his
own
actions 
and
to
the
law
of
the
universe
in
everything
else
which
happens 
as
for
what
any
one
may
say
or
think
of
him
or
do
against
him 
he
gives
it
not
a
thought 
but
contents
himself
with
these
two
things 
to
do
justly
what
he
has
in
hand 
and
to
love
the
lot
appointed
for
him 
such
a
man
has
thrown
off
all
hurry
and
bustle 
and
has
no
other
will
but
this 
to
keep
the
straight
path
according
to
the
law 
and
to
follow
god
whose
path
is
ever
straight 
   
what
need
for
suspicion
when
it
is
open
for
you
to
consider
what
ought
to
be
done 
if
you
see
your
way 
proceed
in
it
calmly 
inflexibly 
if
you
do
not
see
it 
pause
and
consult
the
best
advisers 
if
any
other
obstacle
arise 
proceed
with
prudent
caution 
according
to
the
means
you
have 
keeping
always
close
to
what
appears
just 
that
is
the
best
to
which
you
can
attain 
and
failure
in
that
is
the
only
proper
miscarriage 
he
who
in
everything
follows
reason
is
always
at
leisure 
yet
ever
ready
for
action 
always
cheerful 
yet
composed 
   
as
soon
as
you
awake
ask
yourself 
will
it
be
of
consequence
to
you
if
what
is
just
and
good
be
done
by
some
other
man 
it
will
not 
have
you
forgotten
what
manner
of
men
in
bed
and
at
table
are
those
who
make
such
display
in
praise
and
blame
of
others 
what
they
do 
what
they
shun
and
what
they
pursue 
how
they
steal
and
how
they
rob 
not
with
hands
and
feet
but
with
their
most
precious
part 
whereby 
if
a
man
will 
he
may
gain
faith 
modesty 
truth 
law 
a
good
directing
spirit 
   
to
nature 
which
gives
and
again
resumes
all
things 
the
well instructed 
modest
man
will
say 
 give
what
thou
wilt 
take
again
what
thou
wilt  
and
this
he
says 
not
with
ostentation 
but
out
of
pure
obedience
and
good
will
to
nature 
   
what
remains
to
you
of
this
life
is
little 
live
as
on
a
mountain 
for
it
makes
no
difference
whether
we
live
here
or
there 
provided
we
live
like
citizens
everywhere
in
the
world 
let
men
see
and
know
you
as
a
man
indeed 
living
according
to
nature 
if
they
cannot
endure
you 
let
them
slay
you 
it
is
better
so
than
to
live
as
they
live 
   
discourse
no
more
of
what
a
good
man
should
be 
but
be
one 
   
constantly
imagine
all
time
and
all
existence 
and
think
that
every
individual
thing
is
in
substance
a
fig
seed 
and
in
time
the
turn
of
an
auger 
   
consider
each
of
the
things
around
you
as
already
dissolving 
in
a
state
of
change 
and
as
it
were
corrupting
and
being
dissipated 
or
as 
one
and
all 
formed
by
nature
to
die 
   
what
sort
of
men
are
they
when
they
are
eating 
sleeping 
procreating 
easing
nature 
and
the
like 
then
see
them
lording
it
over
their
fellows 
puffed
up
with
pride 
angry 
or
issuing
judgments
from
on
high 
to
how
many
were
they
slaves
but
lately 
and
why 
and
in
what
case
will
they
shortly
be 
   
that
is
for
the
advantage
of
every
man
which
is
brought
by
universal
nature 
and
for
his
advantage
at
the
very
time
at
which
she
brings
it 
   
 earth
loves
the
rain  
 and
the
majestic
ether
loves  
the
universe
loves
to
bring
about
whatever
is
coming
to
be 
i
then
will
say
to
the
universe 
 what
thou
lovest
i
love  
is
it
not
a
common
saying
that 
 so and so
loves
to
happen  
   
either
you
are
living
here
your
accustomed
life 
or
you
are
going
abroad 
and
that
at
your
own
will 
or
you
are
dying 
and
your
public
office
is
discharged 
now 
besides
these
there
is
nothing 
be
therefore
of
good
courage 
   
keep
this
ever
clear
before
you 
that
a
country
retreat
is
just
like
any
other
place 
all
things
here
go
the
same
as
on
a
mountain
top 
or
on
the
sea
beach 
or
where
you
will 
you
may
always
find
that
life
of
the
wise
man
who 
in
platonic
phrase 
 makes
the
city
wall
serve
him
for
a
shepherd s
fold
on
the
mountains  
   
what
is
my
soul
to
me 
what
am
i
making
of
it 
and
to
what
purpose
am
i
now
using
it 
is
it
void
of
understanding 
is
it
loosened
and
rent
from
the
great
community 
is
it
glued
to 
and
mingled
with 
the
flesh
so
as
to
follow
each
fleshly
motion 
   
whoever
flies
from
his
master
is
a
runaway 
our
master
is
the
law 
and
the
law breaker
is
a
runaway 
and
so
is
he
also
who
through
grief 
or
anger 
or
fear
will
not
acquiesce
in
something
that
has
happened 
is
happening 
or
will
happen 
in
the
course
of
things
predestined
by
the
all ruling
power
which
is
the
law 
laying
down
for
every
man
what
is
proper
for
him 
he
then
who
is
afraid
or
grieved
or
angry 
is
a
runaway 
   
he
who
has
cast
seed
into
the
womb
departs 
another
cause
takes
and
works
upon
it
and
completes
the
child 
how
wonderful
the
result
from
such
a
beginning 
the
child 
again 
takes
food
down
its
throat 
another
cause
takes
and
transforms
it
into
sensation 
motion 
in
a
word
into
life
and
strength
and
other
things 
how
many
and
surprising 
consider
then
these
things
happening
in
such
hidden
ways 
and
view
the
power
which
produces
them
just
as
we
perceive
the
gravitation
and
levitation
of
bodies 
not
indeed
with
our
eyes 
yet
none
the
less
clearly 
   
continually
reflect
that
all
that
is
happening
now
happened
exactly
in
the
same
way
before 
and
reflect
that
the
like
will
happen
again 
place
before
your
eyes
all
that
you
have
ever
known
from
your
own
experience
or
from
ancient
history 
dramas
and
scenes 
all
similar 
such
as
the
whole
court
of
hadrianus 
the
whole
court
of
antoninus 
the
whole
court
of
philip 
of
alexander 
of
croesus 
all
these
were
similar 
only
the
actors
different 
   
imagine
every
one
who
is
grieved
or
storms
about
anything
whatever 
to
be
like
the
pig
in
a
sacrifice 
which
kicks
and
screams
under
the
knife 
such 
too 
is
he
who 
on
his
couch 
deplores
in
silence 
by
himself 
that
we
are
all
tied
to
our
fate 
reflect
also
that
only
to
a
rational
being
is
it
given
to
submit
to
what
happens
willingly 
the
bare
submission
is
a
necessity
upon
all 
   
look
attentively
on
each
particular
thing
you
do 
and
ask
yourself
if
death
be
a
terror
because
it
deprives
you
of
this 
   
when
you
are
offended
at
any
one s
fault 
turn
at
once
to
yourself
and
consider
of
what
similar
fault
you
yourself
are
guilty 
such
as
esteeming
for
good
things 
money 
pleasure 
a
little
glory 
or
the
like 
by
fixing
your
attention
on
this
you
will
speedily
forget
your
anger 
especially
if
it
occur
to
you
that
he
acts
under
compulsion
and
cannot
do
otherwise 
else 
if
it
be
in
your
power 
relieve
him
from
the
compulsion 
   
when
you
have
seen
satyrio
the
socratic 
think
of
eutyches
or
hymen 
when
you
have
seen
euphrates 
think
of
eutychio
or
silvanus 
when
alciphron
comes
before
you 
think
of
tropaeophorus 
and
when
xenophon
think
of
crito
or
severus 
when
you
look
upon
yourself
think
of
any
of
the
caesars 
and
with
every
man
likewise 
then
let
this
occur
to
you 
where 
now 
are
these 
nowhere 
or
who
can
tell 
for
thus
you
will
see
all
human
things
to
be
smoke
and
nothingness 
especially
if
you
call
to
mind
that
what
has
once
been
changed
will
never
exist
again
through
all
the
infinity
of
time 
why
then
this
concern 
and
why
does
it
not
suffice
you
to
live
out
your
short
span
in
well
ordered
wise 
what
material 
what
a
subject
for
philosophy
you
are
shunning 
for
what
are
all
earthly
things
but
exercises
for
the
rational
power 
when
it
has
viewed
all
things
that
occur
in
life
accurately
and
in
their
natural
order 
abide
then
until
you
have
assimilated
all
these
things 
as
a
strong
stomach
assimilates
every
variety
of
food 
as
a
bright
fire
turns
whatever
you
throw
upon
it
into
flame
and
radiance 
   
let
no
man
have
it
in
his
power
to
say
with
truth
of
you
that
you
are
not
a
man
of
simplicity 
candour 
and
goodness 
but
let
him
prove
to
be
mistaken
who
holds
any
such
opinion
of
you 
this
is
quite
in
your
power 
for
who
shall
hinder
you
from
being
good
and
single hearted 
only
do
you
determine
to
live
no
longer
if
you
cannot
be
such
a
man 
for
neither
does
reason
require 
in
that
case 
that
you
should 
   
in
the
present
matter
what
is
the
soundest
that
can
be
done
or
said 
for 
whatever
that
may
be 
you
are
at
liberty
to
do
or
say
it 
make
no
excuses
as
if
hindered 
you
will
never
cease
from
groaning
until
your
disposition
is
such
that
what
luxury
is
to
men
of
pleasure 
that
to
you
is
doing
what
is
suitable
to
the
constitution
of
man
on
every
occasion
that
is
thrown
or
falls
in
your
way 
you
should
regard
as
enjoyment
everything
which
you
are
at
liberty
to
do
in
accordance
with
your
own
proper
nature 
and
this
liberty
you
have
everywhere 
now
to
the
cylinder
it
is
not
given
to
move
everywhere
with
its
proper
motion 
nor
to
water 
nor
to
fire 
nor
to
any
other
thing
that
is
governed
by
a
natural
law
only 
or
by
a
soul
irrational 
for
there
are
many
circumstances
which
constrain
and
stop
them 
but
intelligent
reason
can
pursue
through
every
obstacle
the
course
for
which
it
was
created 
and
which
it
wills
to
follow 
set
before
your
eyes
this
ease
with
which
reason
makes
its
way
through
all
obstacles 
as
fire
goes
upwards 
a
stone
downwards 
or
a
cylinder
down
a
slope 
and
seek
for
nothing
further 
the
rest
of
man s
difficulties
are
merely
of
the
body 
the
lifeless
part
of
him 
or
else
they
are
such
as
cannot
crush 
or
in
any
way
injure
him
save
through
opinion 
or
the
surrender
of
reason
itself 
otherwise
he
who
suffered
by
them
would
himself
straightway
become
evil 
in
the
case
of
all
other
organisms 
when
mishap
befalls 
the
sufferer
is
thereby
rendered
worse 
but
in
this
respect
it
may
be
said
that
a
man
becomes
better
and
more
praiseworthy
by
rightly
using
his
circumstances 
in
fine 
remember
that
nothing
which
hurts
not
the
city
hurts
the
man
who
is
by
nature
a
citizen 
nor
does
that
hurt
the
city
which
hurts
not
the
law 
now 
none
of
the
things
called
misfortunes
can
hurt
the
law 
accordingly 
what
hurts
not
the
law
can
hurt
neither
city
nor
citizen 
   
to
the
man
who
is
penetrated
with
true
principles 
the
shortest 
the
most
common
hint
is
a
sufficient
memorial
to
keep
him
free
of
sorrow
and
fear 
such
as   
some
leaves
the
winds
blow
down 
the
fruitful
wood
breeds
more
meanwhile 
which
in
springtide
appear 
of
men
thus
ends
one
race 
while
one
is
born 
your
children
are
leaves 
leaves 
too 
the
creatures
who
confidently
cry
aloud
and
deal
out
eulogy 
or 
it
may
be 
curses 
or
who
carp
and
jeer
in
secret 
leaves 
likewise 
are
they
who
transmit
our
fame
to
posterity 
all
these
 in
springtide
appear  
then
the
wind
shakes
them
down 
and
the
forest
grows
more
to
take
their
places 
shortness
of
life
is
common
to
all
things 
yet
you
shun
and
pursue
them 
as
though
they
were
to
have
no
ending 
but
a
little
and
you
will
fall
asleep 
and
anon
others
shall
mourn
for
him
who
carried
your
bier 
   
the
healthy
eye
ought
to
look
on
everything
visible 
and
not
to
say 
 i
want
green  
like
an
eye
that
is
diseased 
sound
hearing
or
sense
of
smell
ought
to
be
ready
for
all
that
can
be
heard
or
smelt 
and
the
healthy
stomach
should
be
equally
disposed
for
all
sorts
of
food 
as
a
mill
for
all
that
it
was
built
to
grind 
so
also
the
healthy
mind
should
be
ready
for
all
things
that
happen 
that
mind
which
says 
 let
my
children
be
spared 
and
let
men
applaud
my
every
action  
is
as
an
eye
which
begs
for
green 
or
as
teeth
which
require
soft
food 
   
there
is
no
man
so
happily
fated
but
that
when
he
is
dying
some
bystander
will
rejoice
at
the
doom
which
is
coming
upon
him 
were
he
a
virtuous
and
wise
man 
will
not
some
one
at
the
last
say
within
himself 
 at
last
i
shall
breathe
freely 
unoppressed
by
this
pedagogue 
he
was
not
indeed
hard
on
any
of
us 
but
i
always
felt
that
he
tacitly
condemned
us  
this
they
would
say
of
a
good
man 
but 
in
my
own
case 
how
many
more
reasons
are
there
why
a
multitude
would
rejoice
to
be
rid
of
me 
you
will
reflect
on
this
when
dying 
and
depart
with
the
less
regret
when
you
consider 
 i
am
leaving
a
life
from
which
my
very
partners 
for
whom
i
toiled 
and
prayed 
and
planned 
are
wishing
me
to
begone 
hoping 
it
may
be 
to
gain
some
additional
advantage
from
my
departure  
why
then
should
one
strive
for
a
longer
sojourn
here 
yet
let
not
your
parting
with
them
be
less
pleasant
on
this
account 
preserve
your
own
character 
remain
to
them
friendly 
benevolent 
gracious 
on
the
other
hand 
depart
from
your
fellow men 
not
as
if
torn
away 
but
let
your
going
be
like
that
of
one
who
dies
an
easy
death 
whose
soul
is
gently
released
from
the
body 
nature
knit
and
cemented
you
to
your
fellows 
but
now
she
parts
you
from
them 
i
part 
then 
as
from
relations 
not
reluctant 
but
unconstrained 
for
death 
too 
is
a
thing
accordant
with
nature 
   
accustom
yourself
as
much
as
possible 
when
any
one
takes
any
action 
to
consider
only 
to
what
end
is
he
working 
but
begin
at
home 
and
examine
yourself
first
of
all 
   
remember
that
the
mover
of
the
puppet
strings
is
the
hidden
principle
within 
it
is
that
which
is
eloquence 
that
which
is
life 
that 
if
i
may
say
so 
which
is
the
man 
never 
in
your
imagination 
confound
that
principle
with
the
surrounding
earthen
vessel
and
the
little
organs
that
are
kneaded
on
to
it 
excepting
that
they
grow
upon
us 
they
are
like
the
carpenter s
axe 
since 
without
the
moving
and
restraining
principle 
none
of
these
parts
in
itself
is
of
any
greater
service
than
the
shuttle
to
the
weaver 
the
pen
to
the
writer 
or
the
whip
to
the
charioteer 
  
these
are
the
characteristics
of
the
rational
soul 
it
beholds
itself 
it
regulates
itself
in
every
part 
it
fashions
itself
as
it
wills 
the
fruit
it
bears
itself
enjoys 
whereas
the
products
of
plants
and
of
the
lower
animals
are
enjoyed
by
others 
it
reaches
its
individual
end 
wheresoever
the
close
of
life
may
overtake
it 
in
a
dance
or
an
actor s
part
any
interruption
spoils
the
completeness
of
the
whole
action 
not
so
with
the
rational
soul 
at
whatever
point
in
its
action 
or
wheresoever
it
is
overtaken
by
death 
it
makes
its
part
complete
and
all sufficient 
so
that
it
can
say 
 i
have
received
what
is
mine  
also
it
ranges
through
the
whole
universe 
and
the
void
around
it 
and
discerns
its
plan 
it
stretches
forth
into
limitless
eternity 
and
grasps
the
periodical
regeneration
of
all
things 
seeing
and
comprehending
that
those
who
come
after
us
will
see
nothing
new 
and
that
those
that
went
before
saw
no
more
than
we
have
seen 
nay 
a
man
of
forty 
of
any
tolerable
understanding 
has 
because
of
the
uniformity
of
things 
seen 
in
a
manner 
all
that
has
been
or
will
be 
characteristic
of
the
rational
soul
also
are   love
to
all
around
us 
truth 
modesty 
and
respect
for
itself
above
all
other
things 
which
is
characteristic
also
of
the
general
law 
thus
there
is
no
discordance
between
right
reason
and
the
reason
of
justice 
  
you
will
think
little
of
a
pleasing
song 
a
dance 
or
a
gymnastic
display 
if
you
analyse
the
melody
into
its
separate
notes 
and
ask
yourself
regarding
each 
 does
this
impress
me  
you
will
blush
to
own
it 
and
so
also
if
you
analyse
the
dance
into
its
single
motions
and
postures 
and
if
you
similarly
treat
the
gymnastic
display 
in
general
then 
except
as
regards
virtue
and
virtuous
action 
remember
to
recur
to
the
constituent
parts
of
things 
and
by
dissecting
to
despise
them 
and
transfer
this
practice
to
life
as
a
whole 
  
how
happy
is
the
soul
that
stands
ready
to
part
from
the
body
when
it
must 
and
either
to
be
extinguished
or
to
be
scattered 
or
to
survive 
but
let
this
readiness
arise
from
individual
judgment 
not
from
mere
obstinacy 
as
with
the
christians 
but
deliberately 
with
dignity 
and
with
no
affected
air
of
tragedy 
so
that
others
may
be
led
to
a
like
disposition 
  
have
i
done
anything
for
the
common
good 
is
not
this
itself
my
advantage 
let
this
thought
be
ever
with
you 
and
desist
not 
  
what
is
your
art 
well
doing 
and
how
else
can
this
come
than
from
sound
general
principles
regarding
nature
as
a
whole 
and
the
constitution
of
man
in
particular 
  
first
of
all 
tragedy
was
introduced
to
remind
us
that
certain
events
happen 
and
are
fated
to
happen
as
they
do 
and
to
teach
us
that
what
entertains
us
on
the
stage
should
not
grieve
us
on
the
greater
stage
of
the
world 
you
see
that
such
things
must
be
accomplished 
and
that
even
they
bore
them
who
cried
aloud 
o
cithaeron 
our
dramatic
poets
have
said
some
excellent
things 
especially
the
following   
me
and
my
children 
if
the
gods
neglect 
it
is
for
some
good
reason  
and
again 
vain
is
all
anger
at
external
things 
and 
to
reap
our
life
like
ears
of
ripened
corn  
and
the
like 
and
after
tragedy
came
the
old
comedy 
using
a
schoolmaster s
freedom
of
speech 
and
employing
plain
language
with
great
profit
to
inculcate
the
duty
of
humility 
to
this
end
diogenes
used
a
method
much
the
same 
next
consider
the
nature
of
the
middle
comedy 
and
lastly
for
what
purpose
the
new
was
introduced 
which
gradually
degenerated
into
the
mere
ingenuity
of
artificial
mimicry 
it
is
well
known
that
some
useful
things
were
said
by
the
new
comic
writers 
but
what
useful
end
had
they
in
view
in
all
their
accumulated
poetry
and
playmaking 
  
how
manifest
it
is
that
no
other
course
of
life
was
more
adapted
to
the
practice
of
philosophy
than
that
which
now
is
yours 
  
a
branch
cut
off
from
its
adjacent
branch
must
necessarily
be
severed
from
the
whole
tree 
even
so
a
man 
parted
from
any
fellow man 
has
fallen
away
from
the
whole
social
community 
now
a
branch
is
cut
off
by
some
external
agency 
but
a
man
by
his
own
action
separates
himself
from
his
neighbour  by
hatred
and
aversion 
unaware
that
he
has
thus
torn
himself
away
from
the
universal
polity 
yet
there
is
always
given
us
the
good
gift
of
zeus 
who
founded
the
great
community 
whereby
it
is
in
our
power
to
be
reingrafted
on
our
kind 
and
to
become
once
more 
natural
parts
completing
the
whole 
yet
the
frequent
happening
of
such
separations 
makes
the
reunion
and
restoration
of
the
separated
member
more
and
more
difficult 
and
in
general
a
branch
which
has
grown
from
the
first
upon
a
tree 
and
remained
a
living
part
of
it 
is
not
like
one
which
has
been
cut
and
reingrafted 
as
the
gardeners
would
say 
they
are
of
the
same
growth
but
of
different
persuasion 
  
as
those
who
oppose
you
in
the
path
of
right
reason
have
no
power
to
divert
you
from
sane
action 
so
let
them
not
turn
you
away
from
amenity
towards
themselves 
be
watchful
alike
to
persist
in
stable
judgment
and
action 
and
in
meekness
towards
those
who
would
hinder
or
otherwise
molest
you 
it
is
equally
weak
to
grow
angry
with
them
or
to
desist
from
action
and
submit
to
defeat 
both
are
equally
deserters  
he
who
runs
away 
and
he
who
refuses
to
stand
by
friend
and
kinsman 
   
nature
cannot
be
inferior
to
art 
the
arts
are
but
imitations
of
nature 
if
this
be
so 
that
nature
which
is
the
most
perfect
and
comprehensive
of
all
cannot
be
inferior
to
the
best
artistic
skill 
now
all
arts
use
inferior
material
for
higher
purposes 
so
also
then
does
universal
nature 
hence
the
origin
of
justice 
from
which
again
the
other
virtues
spring 
justice
cannot
be
preserved
if
we
are
solicitous
about
things
indifferent 
if
we
are
easily
deceived 
rash 
and
changeable 
   
if
those
things 
the
pursuit
and
avoidance
of
which
trouble
you 
come
not
to
you 
but 
as
it
happens 
you
go
to
them 
then
let
your
judgment
be
at
peace
concerning
them 
they
will
remain
motionless 
and
you
will
no
more
be
seen
pursuing
or
avoiding
them 
   
the
sphere
of
the
soul
attains
to
perfect
shape
when
it
neither
expands
to
what
is
without 
nor
contracts
upon
what
is
within 
neither
wrinkles
nor
collapses 
but
shines
with
a
radiance
whereby
it
discerns
the
truth
of
all
things 
both
without
itself
and
within 
   
does
any
man
contemn
me 
let
him
look
to
that 
and
let
me
look
to
it
that
i
be
found
doing
or
saying
nothing
worthy
of
his
contempt 
does
any
one
hate
me 
that
is
his
affair 
i
shall
be
kind
and
good natured
to
every
one 
and
ready
to
shew
his
mistake
to
him
that
hates
me 
not
in
order
to
upbraid
him 
or
to
make
a
show
of
my
patience 
but
from
genuine
goodness 
like
phocion 
if
he
indeed
was
sincere 
your
inward
character
should
be
such
that
the
gods
may
see
you
neither
angry
nor
repining
at
anything 
what
evil
is
it
for
you
now
to
act
according
to
your
nature 
and
to
accept
now
what
is
seasonable
to
the
nature
of
the
universe 
you 
a
man
appointed
to
do
some
service
for
the
common
good 
   
although
they
despise 
yet
they
flatter
one
another 
although
they
desire
to
overtop 
yet
they
cringe
to
one
another 
   
how
rotten
and
insincere
is
his
profession
who
says 
 i
mean
to
deal
straightforwardly
with
you  
what
are
you
doing 
man 
there
is
no
need
for
such
a
preface 
it
will
appear
of
itself 
such
a
profession
should
be
written
clearly
on
your
forehead 
a
man s
character
should
shine
forth
clearly
from
his
eyes 
as
the
beloved
sees
that
he
is
so
in
the
glances
of
those
that
love
him 
the
straightforward 
good
man
should
be
like
one
of
rank
odour
who
can
be
recognised
by
the
passer
by
as
soon
as
he
approaches 
whether
he
will
or
no 
the
ostentation
of
straightforwardness
is
the
knife
under
the
cloak 
nothing
is
baser
than
wolf friendship 
shun
it
above
all
things 
the
good 
straightforward 
kindly
man
bears
all
these
qualities
in
his
eyes 
and
is
not
to
be
mistaken 
   
to
live
the
best
life
is
within
the
power
of
the
soul 
if
it
be
indifferent
to
indifferent
things 
and
it
will
be
indifferent
if
it
looks
on
all
such
things 
severally
and
wholly 
with
discrimination 
mindful
that
not
one
of
them
can
impose
upon
us
an
opinion
concerning
itself 
or
can
come
of
itself
to
us 
things
stand
motionless
without 
and
it
is
we
that
form
opinions
about
them
within 
and 
as
it
were 
write
these
opinions
upon
our
hearts 
we
may
avoid
so
writing
them 
or 
if
one
has
crept
in
unawares 
we
may
instantly
blot
it
out 
 tis
but
for
a
short
time
that
we
shall
need
this
vigilance 
and
then
life
will
cease 
for
the
rest 
why
should
we
hold
this
to
be
difficult 
if
it
be
according
to
nature 
rejoice
in
it 
and
it
will
become
easy
for
you 
if
it
be
contrary
to
nature 
search
out
what
suits
your
nature 
and
follow
it
diligently 
even
though
it
be
attended
with
no
glory 
for
every
man
will
be
forgiven
for
seeking
his
own
proper
good 
   
consider
whence
each
thing
came 
of
what
it
was
compounded 
into
what
it
will
be
changed 
how
it
will
be
with
it
when
changed 
and
that
it
will
suffer
no
evil 
   
as
to
those
who
offend
me 
let
me
consider 
first 
how
i
am
related
to
mankind 
that
we
are
formed 
the
one
for
the
other 
and
that 
in
another
respect 
i
was
set
over
them
as
the
ram
over
the
flock 
and
the
bull
over
the
herd 
consider
yet
more
deeply 
thus   there
is
either
an
empire
of
atoms 
or
an
intelligent
nature
governing
the
whole 
if
the
latter 
the
inferior
beings
are
created
for
the
superior 
and
the
superior
for
each
other 
secondly 
consider
what
manner
of
men
they
are
at
table 
in
bed 
or
elsewhere 
and
especially
by
what
principles
they
hold
themselves
bound 
and
with
what
arrogance
they
entertain
them 
thirdly 
if
they
act
rightly 
we
ought
not
to
take
it
amiss 
and 
if
not
rightly 
manifestly
they
do
so
without
intention
and
in
ignorance 
for
no
soul
is
willingly
deprived
of
truth 
or
of
the
faculty
of
treating
every
man
as
he
deserves 
accordingly
men
are
grieved
to
be
called
unjust 
ungrateful 
greedy 
and 
in
short 
sinners
against
their
neighbours 
fourthly 
you
yourself
do
often
sin 
and
are
no
better
than
another 
and 
if
you
abstain
from
certain
sins 
still
you
have
the
disposition
to
commit
them 
even
if
through
cowardice 
fear
for
your
character 
or
other
meanness 
you
hold
back 
fifthly 
you
cannot
even
be
perfectly
sure
that
wrong
has
been
done 
for
many
things
admit
of
justification 
and 
generally
speaking 
a
man
must
have
learned
much
before
he
can
pronounce
surely
upon
the
conduct
of
others 
sixthly 
when
you
are
vexed
or
worried
overmuch 
remember
that
man s
life
is
but
for
a
moment 
and
that
in
a
little
we
shall
all
be
laid
to
rest 
seventhly 
it
is
not
the
acts
of
others
that
disturb
us 
their
actions
reside
in
their
own
souls 
our
own
opinions
alone
disturb
us 
away
with
them
then 
will
that
you
entertain
no
thought
of
calamity
befallen
you 
and
the
anger
is
gone 
but
how
remove
them 
by
reasoning
that
there
is
no
dishonour 
for 
if
you
hold
not
that
dishonour
alone
is
evil 
verily
you
must
fall
into
many
crimes 
you
may
become
a
robber 
or
any
sort
of
villain 
eighthly 
how
much
worse
evils
we
suffer
from
anger
and
grief
about
certain
things
than
from
the
things
themselves
about
which
these
passions
arise 
ninthly 
meekness
is
invincible
if
it
be
genuine 
without
simper
or
hypocrisy 
for
what
can
the
most
insolent
of
men
do
to
you 
if
you
persist
in
civility
towards
him 
and 
if
occasion
offers 
admonish
him
gently
and
deliberately 
shew
him
the
better
way
at
the
very
moment
that
he
is
endeavouring
to
harm
you 
 nay 
my
son 
we
were
born
for
something
better 
no
hurt
can
come
to
me 
it
is
yourself
you
hurt 
my
son  
and
point
out
to
him
delicately 
and
as
a
general
principle 
how
the
matter
stands 
that
bees
and
other
gregarious
animals
do
not
act
like
him 
but
this
must
be
done
without
irony
or
reproach 
rather
with
loving kindness
and
no
bitterness
of
spirit 
not
as
though
you
were
reading
him
a
lesson 
or
seeking
admiration
from
any
bystander 
but
as
if
you
designed
your
remarks
for
him
alone 
though
others
may
be
present 
remember
these
nine
precepts
as
gifts
received
from
the
muses 
and
begin
now
to
be
human
for
the
rest
of
your
life 
beware
equally
of
being
angry
with
men
and
of
flattering
them 
both
are
unsocial
and
lead
to
mischief 
in
all
anger
recollect
that
wrath
is
not
becoming
to
a
man 
but
that
meekness
and
gentleness 
as
they
are
more
human 
are
also
more
manly 
strength
and
nerves
and
courage
are
the
portion
of
the
meek
and
gentle
man 
and
not
of
the
irascible
and
impatient 
for
the
nearer
a
man
attains
to
freedom
from
passion 
the
nearer
he
comes
to
strength 
a
weak
man
in
grief
is
like
a
weak
man
in
anger 
both
are
hurt 
and
both
give
way 
if
you
want
a
tenth
gift 
from
the
leader
of
the
muses 
take
this   
to
expect
the
wicked
not
to
sin
is
madness 
it
is
to
expect
an
impossibility 
but
to
allow
them
to
injure
others 
and
to
forbid
them
to
injure
you 
is
foolish
and
tyrannical 
   
there
are
four
states
of
the
soul
against
which
you
must
continually
and
especially
be
upon
your
guard 
and
which 
when
detected 
should
be
effaced 
by
remarking
thus
of
each 
 this
thought
is
unnecessary 
this
tends
to
social
dissolution 
you
could
not
say
this
from
your
heart 
and
to
speak
otherwise
than
from
the
heart
you
must
regard
as
the
most
absurd
conduct  
and 
fourthly 
whatever
causes
self reproach
is
an
overpowering
or
subjection
of
the
diviner
part
within
you
to
the
less
honourable
and
mortal
part 
the
body 
and
to
its
grosser
tendencies 
   
the
serial
and
igneous
parts
of
which
you
are
compounded 
although
they
naturally
tend
upwards 
nevertheless
obey
the
general
law
of
the
universe 
and
are
retained
here
in
composition 
the
earthy
and
humid
parts
of
you 
though
they
naturally
tend
downwards 
are
nevertheless
supported
and
remain
where
they
are 
although
not
in
their
natural
situation 
thus
the
elements 
wheresoever
placed
by
the
superior
power 
obey
the
whole 
waiting
till
the
signal
shall
sound
again
for
their
dissolution 
is
it
not
grievous
that
the
intellectual
part
alone
should
be
disobedient 
and
fret
at
its
function 
yet
is
no
violence
done
to
it 
nothing
imposed
contrary
to
its
nature 
still
it
is
impatient 
and
tends
to
opposition 
for
all
its
tendencies
towards
injustice 
debauchery 
wrath 
sorrows 
and
fears
are
so
many
departures
from
nature 
and 
when
the
soul
frets
at
any
particular
event 
it
is
deserting
its
appointed
station 
it
is
formed
for
holiness
and
piety
toward
god 
no
less
than
for
justice 
these
last
are
branches
of
social
goodness
even
more
venerable
than
the
practice
of
justice 
   
he
whose
aim
in
life
is
not
always
one
and
the
same
cannot
himself
be
one
and
the
same
through
his
whole
life 
but
singleness
of
aim
is
not
sufficient 
unless
you
consider
also
what
that
aim
ought
to
be 
for 
as
there
is
not
agreement
of
opinion
regarding
all
those
things
which
are
reckoned
good
by
the
majority 
but
only
as
regards
some
of
them
such
as
are
of
public
utility 
so
your
aim
should
be
social
and
political 
for
he
alone
who
directs
all
his
personal
aims
to
such
an
end
can
reach
a
uniform
course
of
conduct 
and
thus
be
ever
the
same
man 
   
remember
the
country
mouse
and
the
town
mouse 
and
how
the
latter
feared
and
trembled 
   
socrates
called
the
maxims
of
the
vulgar
hobgoblins 
bogies
to
frighten
children 
   
the
spartans
at
their
public
shows
set
seats
for
strangers
in
the
shade 
but
sat
themselves
where
they
found
room 
   
socrates
made
this
excuse
for
not
going
to
perdiccas
upon
his
invitation 
 lest
i
should
come
to
the
worst
of
all
ends 
by
receiving
favours
which
i
could
not
return  
   
in
the
writings
of
the
ephesians
there
is
a
precept 
frequently
to
call
to
remembrance
some
of
those
who
cultivated
virtue
of
old 
   
the
pythagoreans
recommended
that
we
should
look
at
the
heavens
in
the
morning 
to
put
us
in
mind
of
beings
that
go
on
doing
their
proper
work
uniformly
and
continuously 
and
of
their
order 
purity
and
naked
simplicity 
for
there
is
no
veil
upon
a
star 
   
think
of
socrates
clad
in
a
skin 
when
xanthippe
had
taken
his
cloak
and
gone
out 
and
what
he
said
to
his
friends 
who
were
ashamed 
and
would
have
left
him
when
they
saw
him
dressed
in
such
an
extraordinary
fashion 
   
in
writing
and
reading
you
must
be
led
before
you
can
lead 
much
more
is
this
so
in
life 
   
yourself
a
slave 
your
speech
cannot
be
free 
   
and
my
heart
laughed
within
me 
   
virtue
herself
they
blame
with
harshest
words 
   
to
look
for
figs
in
winter
is
madness 
and
so
it
is
to
long
for
a
child
that
may
no
longer
be
yours 
   
epictetus
said
that 
when
you
kiss
your
child 
you
should
whisper
within
yourself 
 to morrow
perhaps
he
may
die  
 ill omened
words  
say
you 
 the
words
have
no
evil
omen  
says
he 
 but
simply
indicate
an
act
of
nature 
is
it
of
evil
omen
to
say
the
corn
is
reaped  
   
the
green
grape 
the
ripe
cluster 
the
dried
grape
are
all
changes 
not
into
nothing 
but
into
that
which
is
not
at
present 
   
no
man
can
rob
you
of
your
liberty
of
action 
as
has
been
said
by
epictetus 
   
he
tells
us
also
that
we
must
find
out
the
true
art
of
assenting 
and
in
treating
of
our
impulses
he
says
that
we
must
be
vigilant
in
restraining
them 
that
they
may
act
with
proper
reservation 
with
public
spirit 
with
due
sense
of
proportion 
also
that
we
should
refrain
utterly
from
sensual
passion 
and
not
be
restive
in
matters
where
we
have
no
control 
   
the
contention
is
not
about
any
chance
matter 
said
he 
but
as
to
whether
we
are
insane
or
sane 
   
what
do
you
desire 
says
socrates 
to

rational
of
what

virtuous
or

virtuous 
why
then
do
you
not
seek
after
such
souls 
because
we
have
them
already 
why
then
do
you
fight
and
stand
at
variance 
  
all
that
you
desire
to
compass
by
devious
means
is
yours
already 
if
you
will
but
freely
take
it 
that
is
to
say 
if
you
will
leave
behind
you
all
that
is
past 
commit
the
future
to
providence 
and
regulate
the
present
in
piety
and
justice 
in
piety
that
you
may
love
your
appointed
lot 
for
nature
gave
it
to
you
and
you
to
it 
in
justice 
that
you
may
speak
the
truth
with out
constraint
or
guile 
that
you
may
do
what
is
lawful
and
proper 
that
you
may
not
be
hindered
by
the
wickedness
of
others 
or
by
their
opinion 
or
their
talk 
or
by
any
sensation
of
this
poor
surrounding
body 
for
the
part
concerned
may
look
to
that 
if
then 
now
that
you
are
near
your
exit 
setting
behind
you
all
other
things 
you
will
hold
alone
in
reverence
your
ruling
part 
the
spirit
divine
within
you 
if
you
will
cease
to
dread
the
end
of
life 
but
rather
fear
to
miss
the
beginning
of
life
according
to
nature 
you
will
be
a
man 
worthy
of
the
ordered
universe
that
produced
you 
you
will
cease
to
be
a
stranger
in
your
own
country 
gaping
in
wonder
at
every
daily
happening 
caught
up
by
this
trifle
or
by
that 
  
god
beholds
all
souls
bare
and
stripped
of
these
corporeal
vessels 
husk 
and
refuse 
by
his
intelligence
alone
he
touches
that
only
which
has
been
instilled
by
him
and
has
emanated
from
himself 
if
you
would
but
inure
yourself
to
do
the
like 
you
would
be
eased
of
many
a
torment 
for
he
who
regards
not
the
surrounding
flesh
will
not
waste
his
leisure
in
thinking
about
vesture 
house 
or
fame 
or
other
mere
external
furniture
or
accoutrement 
  
three
parts
there
are
of
which
you
are
compact 
body 
soul 
intelligence 
of
these
the
two
first
are
yours
in
so
far
as
they
must
have
your
care 
the
third
only
is
properly
your
own 
and
if
you
will
cast
away
from
yourself 
that
is
from
your
mind 
all
that
others
do
or
say 
all
that
you
yourself
have
done
or
said 
all
your
fears
for
the
future 
all
the
uncontrollable
accompaniments
of
the
body
that
envelops
you
and
of
its
congenital
soul 
and
all
that
is
whirled
in
the
besieging
vortex
that
races
without 
so
that
your
intellectual
power 
made
pure 
and
set
above
the
accidents
of
fate 
may
live
its
own
life
in
freedom 
just 
resigned 
veracious 
if 
i
repeat 
you
cast
out
from
your
soul
all
comes
of
excessive
attachment
either
to
the
past
or
to
the
future 
then
you
will
become
in
the
words
of
empedocles 
a
faultless
sphere
rejoiced
in
endless
rest 
you
will
study
to
live
the
only
life
there
is
to
live 
to
wit
the
present 
and
you
will
be
able 
till
death
shall
come 
to
spend
what
remains
of
life
in
noble
tranquillity 
at
peace
with
the
spirit
within 
  
i
have
wondered
often
how
it
comes
that 
while
every
man
loves
himself
beyond
all
others 
yet
he
holds
his
own
opinion
of
himself
in
less
esteem
than
the
opinion
of
others 
yet 
if
a
god
or
some
wise
teacher
came
and
ordered
a
man
to
conceive
and
design
nothing
which
he
would
not
utter
the
moment
it
occurred
to
him 
he
would
not
abide
the
ordeal
for
a
single
day 
thus
we
stand
in
greater
awe
of
our
neighbours 
opinion
of
us
than
we
do
of
our
own 
  
how
can
it
be
that
the
gods 
who
have
ordered
all
things
well
for
man s
advantage 
overlooked
one
thing
only 
to
wit
that
some
of
the
best
of
mankind 
who
have
held
the
closest
relations
with
things
divine 
and
by
pious
works
and
holy
ministry
become
intimate
with
the
divinity 
once
dead 
should
arise
no
more 
but
be
altogether
extinguished 
if
this
be
truly
so 
be
well
assured
that 
if
it
ought
to
have
been
otherwise
they
would
have
made
it
otherwise 
had
it
been
right
it
would
have
been
practicable 
and
had
it
been
according
to
nature 
nature
would
have
effected
it 
from
its
not
being
so 
if
it
really
be
not
so 
be
persuaded
that
it
ought
not
to
have
been 
you
see
that 
in
debating
this
matter 
you
are
pleading
a
point
of
justice
with
the
gods 
now
we
would
not
thus
plead
with
the
gods
were
they
not
perfectly
good
and
just 
and 
if
they
are
so 
they
have
left
nothing
unjustly
and
unreasonably
neglected
in
their
administration 
  
essay
even
tasks
that
you
despair
of
executing 
the
left
hand 
which
in
other
things
is
of
little
value
for
want
of
use 
yet
holds
the
bridle
more
firmly
than
the
right 
for
in
this
it
has
practice 
  
consider
how
death
ought
to
find
you 
both
as
to
body
and
as
to
soul 
think
of
the
shortness
of
life 
of
the
eternities
before
and
after 
and
of
the
infirmity
of
all
material
things 
  
contemplate
the
fundamental
causes
stripped
of
disguises 
think
what
pain
is 
what
pleasure
is 
what
death 
and
what
fame 
consider
how
many
are
themselves
the
causes
of
all
the
disquiet
that
they
suffer 
how
no
man
may
be
hindered
by
another 
how
all
is
matter
of
opinion 
  
in
the
use
of
principles
we
should
be
like
the
pugilist
rather
than
the
swordsman 
for
when
the
latter
drops
the
sword
which
he
uses
he
is
undone 
but
the
former
has
his
hand
always
by
him
and
needs
but
to
wield
it 
   
consider
well
the
nature
of
things 
distinguishing
between
matter 
cause 
and
purpose 
   
what
a
glorious
power
is
given
to
man 
never
to
do
any
action
of
which
god
will
not
approve 
and
to
welcome
whatever
god
appoints
for
him 
   
as
to
what
happens
in
the
course
of
nature 
the
gods
are
not
to
be
blamed 
they
never
do
wrong 
willingly
or
unwillingly 
neither
are
men
to
be
blamed 
for
they
do
no
wrong
willingly 
there
is
therefore
none
to
blame 
   
how
ridiculous 
and
how
like
a
foreigner 
is
he
who
is
surprised
at
anything
which
happens
in
life 
   
there
is
either
a
fatal
necessity 
an
unalterable
order 
or
a
placable
providence 
or
a
blind
confusion
without
a
governor 
if
there
be
an
unalterable
necessity 
why
strive
against
it 
if
there
be
a
providence
admitting
of
propitiation 
make
yourself
worthy
of
the
divine
aid 
if
there
be
an
ungoverned
confusion 
be
comforted 
seeing
that
in
this
tempest
you
have
within
yourself
a
guiding
intelligence 
and 
if
the
wave
should
carry
you
away 
let
it
carry
away
the
carcase
and
the
animal
life 
for
the
intellectual
part
of
you
it
will
not
carry
away 
   
if
the
light
of
a
lamp
shine
and
lose
not
its
radiance
until
it
be
extinguished 
shall
truth 
justice 
and
temperance
be
extinguished
in
you
before
your
own
extinction 
   
when
you
have
the
impression
that
a
man
has
sinned 
say
to
yourself 
 how
do
i
know
that
this
is
sin  
and 
if
he
has
sinned 
consider
that
he
stands
self condemned 
and
thus 
as
it
were 
has
torn
his
own
face 
he
that
would
wish
the
wicked
not
to
sin
is
like
one
who
would
have
the
fig
tree
not
have
juice
in
its
figs 
would
have
infants
not
cry 
horses
not
neigh 
and
other
inevitable
things
not
happen 
what
shall
the
wicked
man
do 
having
a
wicked
disposition 
if
you
are
so
keen 
cure
it 
   
if
a
thing
be
not
becoming 
do
it
not 
if
not
true 
say
it
not 
   
endeavour
always
to
see
in
everything
what
it
is
that
causes
your
impression 
and
unfold
it
by
distinguishing
the
cause 
the
matter 
the
relation
to
other
things 
and
the
period
within
which
it
must
cease
to
exist 
   
perceive
at
last
that
there
is
within
you
something
better
and
more
divine
than
the
immediate
cause
of
your
sensations
of
pleasure
and
pain 
something 
in
short 
beyond
the
strings
which
move
the
puppet 
what
is
now
my
thought 
is
it
fear 
suspicion 
lust 
or
any
such
passion 
   
in
the
first
place 
let
nothing
be
done
at
random
or
without
an
object 
in
the
second
let
your
object
never
be
other
than
the
common
good 
   
yet
a
little 
and
you
shall
be
no
more 
nor
shall
any
of
these
things
remain
which
you
now
behold 
nor
any
of
those
who
are
now
living 
it
is
the
nature
of
all
things
to
change 
to
turn 
and
to
corrupt 
in
order
that
other
things
may 
in
their
course 
spring
out
of
them 
   
reflect
that
everything
is
matter
of
opinion 
and
opinion
rests
with
yourself 
suppress
then
your
opinion 
what
time
you
will 
and
like
one
who
has
doubled
the
cape
and
reached
the
bay 
you
will
have
calm
and
stillness
everywhere 
never
a
wave 
   
any
one
natural
operation 
ending
at
its
proper
time 
suffers
no
ill
by
ceasing 
nor
does
the
agent
therein
suffer
any
ill
by
its
thus
ceasing 
in
like
manner 
as
to
the
whole
series
of
actions
which
is
life 
if
it
ends
in
its
season
it
suffers
no
ill
by
ceasing 
nor
is
he
who
thus
completes
his
series 
in
any
evil
case 
the
season
and
the
term
are
assigned
by
nature 
sometimes
even
by
your
own
nature 
as
in
old
age 
but
always
by
the
nature
of
the
whole 
by
the
interchange
of
whose
parts
the
universe
still
remains
fresh
and
in
its
bloom 
now 
that
is
always
good
and
seasonable
which
is
advantageous
to
the
nature
of
the
whole 
wherefore
the
ceasing
of
life
cannot
be
evil
to
the
individual 
there
is
no
turpitude
in
it 
since
it
is
beyond
our
power 
and
contains
nothing
contrary
to
the
common
advantage 
nay 
it
is
good 
since
it
is
seasonable
and
advantageous
to
the
whole 
and 
congruent
with
the
order
of
the
universe 
thus 
too 
he
is
led
by
god
who
goes
the
same
way
with
god 
and
that
by
like
inclination 
   
have
these
three
thoughts
always
at
hand 
first 
as
to
your
action 
do
nothing
inconsiderately 
or
otherwise
than
justice
herself
would
have
acted 
as
for
external
events 
they
either
happen
by
chance
or
by
providence 
now 
no
man
should
quarrel
with
chance
or
censure
providence 
second 
examine
what
each
thing
is 
from
its
seed
to
its
quickening 
and
from
its
quickening
to
its
death 
of
what
materials
it
is
composed 
and
into
what
it
will
be
resolved 
third 
reflect
that
could
you
be
raised
on
high 
and
from
thence
behold
all
human
affairs 
you
would
discern
their
great
variety 
conscious
at
the
same
time
of
the
crowds
of
serial
and
etherial
inhabitants
around
us 
but
were
you
so
raised
ever
so
often 
you
would
always
see
the
same
things 
all
uniform
and
of
brief
duration 
can
we
set
our
pride
on
such
matters 
   
 cast
away
opinion 
and
you
are
saved  
who
then
hinders
you
from
casting
it
away 
   
when
you
fret
at
anything 
you
have
forgotten
that
all
happens
in
accordance
with
the
nature
of
the
universe 
and
that
the
wrong
done
was
another s 
this 
too 
that
whatever
happens
has
happened 
and
will
happen 
and
is
now
happening
everywhere 
you
have
also
forgotten
how
great
is
the
bond
between
any
man
and
all
the
human
race 
a
bond
not
of
blood
and
seed 
but
of
common
intelligence 
you
have
forgotten
that
the
intelligence
of
every
man
is
divine 
and
an
efflux
from
god 
also
that
no
man
is
proprietor
of
anything 
his
children 
his
body 
his
very
life
are
given
of
god 
you
have
forgotten 
too 
that
everything
is
matter
of
opinion 
and
that
it
is
the
present
moment
only
that
one
can
live
or
lose 
   
bring
to
frequent
recollection
those
who
have
grieved
about
anything
overmuch 
those
who
have
been
pre eminent
in
the
extreme
of
glory
or
misfortune 
in
feuds
or
other
circumstances
of
fate 
then
stop
and
ask 
where
are
they
all
now 
smoke
and
ashes 
and
an
old
tale 
or
perhaps
not
even
a
tale 
pass
them
all
in
review 
fabius
catullinus
in
the
country 
lucius
lupus
in
his
gardens 
stertinius
at
baiae 
tiberius
at
capreae 
velius
rufus 
and 
in
fine 
all
eminence
attended
with
the
high
regard
of
men 
how
cheap
is
all
that
is
so
eagerly
pursued 
and
how
much
better
does
it
become
a
philosopher
to
show
himself 
in
the
part
of
the
material
world
allotted
to
him 
just 
temperate 
and
obedient
to
the
gods 
and
this
with
simplicity 
for
most
intolerable
of
all
is
the
pride
of
false
humility 
   
to
those
who
ask 
 where
have
you
seen
the
gods 
and
how
assured
yourself
of
their
existence 
that
you
worship
them  
make
this
reply 
first 
they
are
visible 
even
to
the
eye 
again 
my
own
soul
i
cannot
see 
and
yet
i
reverence
it 
thus 
too 
as
regards
the
gods 
i
continually
feel
their
power 
and
so
i
know
that
they
exist 
and
i
worship
them 
   
the
safety
of
life
is
to
see
the
whole
nature
of
everything 
and
to
discern
the
matter
and
the
form
of
its
constitution 
also
to
do
justice
with
all
your
heart 
and
to
speak
the
truth 
what
remains
but
to
enjoy
life 
adding
one
good
to
an
another 
so
as
not
to
lose
the
smallest
interval 
   
there
is
but
one
light
of
the
sun 
although
it
be
scattered
upon
walls
and
hills 
and
a
myriad
other
objects 
there
is
but
one
common
substance 
although
it
be
divided
among
ten
thousand
bodies
having
as
many
different
qualities 
there
is
but
one
soul 
though
it
be
distributed
among
countless
different
natures
and
individual
forms 
there
is
but
one
intelligent
spirit 
though
it
may
seem
to
be
divided 
the
other
parts
of
these
individuals
of
which
we
have
spoken 
such
as
breath
and
matter 
are
void
of
perception
and
of
mutual
affection 
yet
even
they
are
held
together
by
the
intelligent
spirit
and
gravitate
together 
but
intelligence
has
a
special
tendency
to
its
kind 
and
unites
therewith 
and
the
community
of
feeling
is
not
broken 
   
what
do
you
desire 
to
live
on 
or
is
it
to
feel
or
to
desire 
to
grow
and
to
decay
again 
to
speak
or
think 
which
of
all
these
seems
worthy
to
be
desired 
and 
if
each
and
all
of
them
is
despicable 
proceed
to
the
last
that
remains 
to
follow
reason
and
god 
now 
it
is
repugnant
to
reverence
for
reason
and
for
god
to
grieve
at
the
loss
by
death
of
these
other
despicable
things 
   
how
small
a
part
of
the
boundless
immensity
of
the
ages
is
allotted
to
each
of
us 
and
presently
that
will
vanish
in
eternity 
how
little
is
ours
of
the
universal
substance 
how
little
of
the
universal
spirit 
on
what
a
little
clod
of
the
whole
earth
do
we
creep 
considering
all
this 
reckon
nothing
great
except
to
act
as
your
nature
leads
you 
and
to
endure
what
universal
nature
brings
to
pass 
   
how
is
it
with
your
ruling
part 
on
this
all
depends 
all
other
things 
within
or
without
our
control 
are
but
corpses 
dust 
and
smoke 
   
this
most
of
all
must
rouse
you
to
despise
death 
that
even
those
who
held
pleasure
to
be
good
and
pain
to
be
evil
nevertheless
despised
it 
   
to
him
who
holds
that
alone
to
be
good
which
comes
in
proper
season 
who
cares
not
whether
he
has
acted
oftener
or
less
often
according
to
right
reason 
to
whom
it
makes
no
difference
whether
he
behold
the
universe
for
a
longer
time
or
a
shorter  for
this
man
death
also
has
no
terror 
   
you
have
lived 
o
man 
as
a
citizen
of
this
great
city 
of
what
consequence
to
you
whether
for
five
years
or
for
three 
what
comes
by
law
is
fair
to
all 
where
then
is
the
calamity 
if
you
are
sent
out
of
the
city 
by
no
tyrant
or
unjust
judge 
but
nature
herself
who
at
first
introduced
you 
just
as
the
praetor
who
engaged
the
actor
again
dismisses
him
from
the
stage 
 but  
say
you 
 i
have
not
spoken
my
five
acts 
but
only
three  
true 
but
in
life
three
acts
make
up
the
play 
for
he
sets
the
end
who
was
responsible
for
its
composition
at
the
first 
and
for
its
present
dissolution 
you
are
responsible
for
neither 
depart
then
graciously 
for
he
who
dismisses
you
is
gracious
